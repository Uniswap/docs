The Uniswap V3 SDK consists of two repositories, which can be downloaded via two npm packages, [V3 SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/v3-sdk), and [SDK Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/sdk-core).

The reference documentation here will be updated intermittently. For the most comprehensive and up to date reference material, we recommend referencing the github repo directly: [V3 SDK](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-sdk), [SDK Core](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-sdk-core).
