The Uniswap SDK is separate from the Uniswap protocol. It is designed to assist developers when interacting with the protocol in any environment that can execute JavaScript, such as websites or node scripts. With the SDK, you can manipulate data that has been queried from the EVM using libraries that assist with several needs, such as data modeling and protection from rounding errors.

The following guides will help you use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) to return state date from the EVM, and the Uniswap V3 SDK to manipulate it once it has been retrieved.

# Installation

To interact with the V3 SDK - we recommend installing though the npm package

```javascript
npm i --save-dev @uniswap/v3-sdk
npm i --save-dev @uniswap/sdk-core
```

# Usage

```javascript
import { Pool } from "@uniswap/v3-sdk";
```

# SDK Reference

SDK Reference docs are available at [here](../introduction)
