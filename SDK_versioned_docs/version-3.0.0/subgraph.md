# Uniswap Subgraph Data

Uniswap uses multiple [subgraphs](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) for indexing and organizing data from the Uniswap smart contracts. 
These subgraphs are hosted on The Graph hosted service and can be used to query Uniswap data. 

## Versions and Production Endpoints  

Each version of Uniswap has its own dedicated subgraph, and governance contracts have a dedicated subgraph as well.  

Each subgraph has a dedicated endpoint for querying data, as well as a page on [The Graph explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/) the exposes the schema and available fields to query.
