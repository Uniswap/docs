# The Uniswap V1 SDK

This is the original documentation for the Uniswap V1 SDK, released in 2019. The SDK helps developers interact with the Uniswap protocol in any javascript environment. Uses range from returning chain data for off-chain modeling, to building customized transactions which will be broadcast to the EVM. The Uniswap V1 SDK is no longer under development, for the most recent implimentations of the SDk, see the [V3 SDK](../version-3.0.0/landing.md).
