As an example, if the ratio of x:y in a pair is 10:2 (i.e. the price is 5), and someone naively adds liquidity at 5:2 (a price of 2.5), the contract will simply accept all tokens (changing the price to 3.75 and opening up the market to arbitrage), but only issue pool tokens entitling the sender to the amount of assets sent at the proper ratio, in this case 5:1.

Typically, it's fairly safe to assume that the current fair market price is around what the current reserve ratio is for a pair (because of arbitrage). So, if a user wants to add 1 ETH to a pool, and the current DAI/WETH ratio of the pool is 200/1, it's reasonable to calculate that 200 DAI must be sent along with the ETH, which is an implicit commitment to the price of 200 DAI/1 WETH.
