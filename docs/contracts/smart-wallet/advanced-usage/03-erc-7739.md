ERC-7739 is a standard which defines a defensive rehashing model for external signers on smart contract accounts. This does not apply to signatures from the root EOA (the one delegated to the implementation), but is enforced for all alternative keys which have been added to an account.

The ERC is still in draft [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7739), and has example implementations in [Solady](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/main/src/accounts/ERC1271.sol) and [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-community-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/signers/ERC7739.sol). We are looking forward to its finalization and welcome any comments / feedback from the community.

Viem has a client-side implementation [here](https://viem.sh/experimental/erc7739/signTypedData)
