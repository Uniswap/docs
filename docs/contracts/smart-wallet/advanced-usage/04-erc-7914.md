ERC-7914 is a standard which adds native Ether “transfer from” functionality to smart contract wallets. It allows for our Smart Wallet to approve other accounts and contracts to spend ETH, which is not possible today with Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). 

We are contributors to the [ERC](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/blob/8380220418521ff1995445cff5ca1d0e496a3d2d/ERCS/erc-7914.md) and welcome any feedback from the community on the spec or our implementation.

Calibur’s reference implementation is [here](https://github.com/Uniswap/calibur/blob/main/src/ERC7914.sol).
