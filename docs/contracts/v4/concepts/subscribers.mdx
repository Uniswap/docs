Subscribers, new in Uniswap v4, allow for liquidity-position owners to opt-in to a contract that receives _notifications_.
The new design is intended to support _liquidity mining_, additional rewards given to in-range liquidity providers. Through notification logic, position owners do not need
to risk their liquidity position and its underlying assets. In Uniswap v3, _liquidity mining_ was supported by fully transferring the 
liquidity position to an external contract; this old design would give the external contract full ownership and control of the liquidity position.

When a position owner _subscribes_ to a contract, the contract will receive notifcations when:

* The position is initially subscribed

* The position increases or decreases its liquidity

* The position is transferred

* The position is unsubscribed
