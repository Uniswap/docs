# Security Considerations

When building on Uniswap V4, security should be a primary consideration. This section covers emergency response resources and security best practices specific to V4 implementations.

## Emergency Response

### SEAL 911 Emergency Hotline

If you encounter a security incident (exploit, vulnerability, or other urgent security matter) while working with Uniswap V4, the SEAL 911 Emergency Hotline provides immediate access to security experts.

**Emergency Contact**: https://t.me/seal_911_bot

SEAL 911 is a community-operated Telegram bot that connects you directly with vetted security responders who can provide immediate assistance during security incidents.

#### How It Works
- Send a message through the bot during a security emergency
- Automatic alert routing to a vetted group of white hat security professionals
- Immediate response from trusted security experts in the space

#### Additional Resources
- [SEAL 911 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/security-alliance/seal-911)
- [Security Alliance Website](https://www.securityalliance.org/seal-911)

:::note
SEAL 911 is a third-party service operated by the Security Alliance. Exercise appropriate judgment when sharing sensitive information during emergency situations.

## V4-Specific Security Considerations

### Hook Security
When developing custom hooks for V4, ensure proper validation and access controls. Malicious or poorly implemented hooks can compromise pool security.

### Flash Accounting
V4's flash accounting system requires careful implementation to prevent exploitation. Always ensure proper settlement of deltas.

### Pool Manager Interactions
Direct interactions with the PoolManager require thorough understanding of the locking mechanism and callback patterns.

## Bug Bounty Program

For non-emergency security issues, report vulnerabilities through Uniswap's official [bug bounty program](https://uniswap.org/bug-bounty/).

## Additional Security Resources

- Review the [V4 Core contracts](../reference/core/) for implementation details
- Follow security best practices outlined in the [Hooks documentation](./04-hooks.mdx)
- Test thoroughly using the provided [test contracts](../reference/core/test/)
