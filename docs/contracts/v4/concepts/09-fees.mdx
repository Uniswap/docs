# v4 Fee Structure Guide

## Overview of Fee Types

In Uniswap v4, there are three main types of fees to understand:

- **LP Fee**: Fees earned by liquidity providers
- **Protocol Fee**: Fees collected by the protocol
- **Swap Fee**: Total fee paid by swappers (calculated by applying protocol fee and LP fee sequentially)

---

## LP Fees

LP fees are set by the pool initializer at pool creation and may be static or dynamic.

**Fee Range:**

- Maximum LP Fee: 100%
- Minimum LP Fee: 0%
- **Granularity**: Fees are set at pip-level precision

### Static LP Fees

- **Immutable** once set during pool initialization
- **Unlimited fee options** in v4 (major improvement from v3)
- In **v3**, LP fee options were limited to: 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1.00%

### Dynamic LP Fees

Dynamic fees offer more flexibility and real-time adjustability:

- A dynamic fee pool signals this capability by setting its LP fee to `0x800000` (where the first bit = 1)
- **Only the pool's hook** can update the dynamic fee—no additional permissions required
- A hook **cannot** update fees if the pool's fee is not set to `0x800000`

## Protocol Fees

Protocol fees are configured **per pool** with the following characteristics:

- Controlled by the **protocol fee controller** (set by the pool manager owner)
- **Maximum protocol fee**: 0.1% (1,000 pips)
- **Granularity**: Fees are set at pip-level precision (not basis points)
- **Unit conversion**: 1 basis point = 100 pips
- **Directional fees**: Separate fees can be set for:
    - token0 → token1 swaps
    - token1 → token0 swaps

## Swap Fees

### Key Change from v3 to v4

**v3 behavior**: Swap fee = LP fee (protocol fee was a percentage taken from LP fees)

**v4 behavior**: Swap fee = effective total fee after applying both protocol and LP fees sequentially

### Application Order

1. **Protocol fee** applied first to the input amount
2. **LP fee** applied second to the remaining input (after protocol fee deduction)

**Impact on LP Earnings:**

Note that this sequential application means introducing or increasing protocol fees will reduce LP earnings even if swap volume remains constant, since LPs now earn fees on a smaller base amount.

### Fee Cap

- **Total swap fee capped at 100%** of input amount
- **Important**: If swap fee = 100%, exact output swaps become impossible (entire input consumed by fees)

### Fee Calculation Formula

```solidity

// Method 1: Sequential application
uint256 swapFee = protocolFee + (lpFee * (1_000_000 - protocolFee)) / 1_000_000; (rounded up)

// Method 2: Mathematically equivalent
uint256 swapFee = protocolFee + lpFee - (protocolFee * lpFee) / 1_000_000;

```

### Mathematical Derivation

Starting with input amount:

```
amountIn
```

**Step 1**: Protocol fee takes:

```
amountIn × (protocolFee / 1_000_000)
```

**Step 2**: Remaining after protocol fee:

```

amountIn × (1 - protocolFee / 1_000_000)
```

**Step 3**: LP fee applies to remaining:

```
lpFee × (remaining amount)
```

**Final formula**:

```
swapFee = protocolFee + (lpFee × (1 - protocolFee / 1_000_000))
```

Which simplifies to:

```
swapFee = protocolFee + lpFee - (protocolFee × lpFee) / 1_000_000
```

## Example Calculation

**Given:**

- `protocolFee = 50` pips → 0.005%
- `lpFee = 3000` pips → 0.30%

**Calculation:**

```solidity
swapFee = 50 + 3000 - (50 × 3000) / 1_000_000
        = 50 + 3000 - 150 / 1_000_000
        = 50 + 3000 - 0.15
        = 3049.85 pips
```

**Result:** 3049.85 pips = **0.304985%** total swap fee

## Key Takeaways

- **Sequential application**: Protocol fees are deducted first, then LP fees apply to the remainder
- **Dynamic flexibility**: v4 introduces unlimited static fee tiers and dynamic fee capabilities
- **Directional control**: Protocol fees can differ by swap direction
- **Fee interaction**: The combined effect is slightly less than simple addition due to sequential application
