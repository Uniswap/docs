In Uniswap v3, each liquidity pool was represented by a separate smart contract deployed through the Uniswapv3Factory contract. While this approach provided flexibility, it also led to increased gas costs for pool creation and multi-hop swaps.

Uniswap v4 addresses this issue by introducing the Singleton design pattern. The PoolManager contract now serves as a single entry point for all liquidity pools. Instead of deploying separate contracts for each pool, the pool state and logic are encapsulated within the PoolManager itself.

# Purpose

The primary purpose of the `PoolManager` is to:

- Efficiently manage liquidity pools
- Facilitate token swaps
- Reduce gas costs compared to the factory-based approach in Uniswap v3
- Enable extensibility through hooks

# Architecture

## Singleton Design

- Uniswap v4 uses a Singleton design pattern for the `PoolManager`
- All pool state and logic are encapsulated within the `PoolManager` contract

## Locking Mechanism

- The `PoolManager` uses a locking mechanism to allow for _flash accounting_ (also known as deferred balance accounting)
- When unlocked, the calling contract can perform various operations and zero-out outstanding balances before returning control to the `PoolManager` for final solvency checks

## Pool State

- The `Pool.State` struct contains information such as:
    - Current price
    - Liquidity
    - Tick bitmap
    - Fee growth
    - Position information

## Libraries

- The pool logic is implemented using Solidity libraries to keep the `PoolManager` contract modular and gas-efficient
- These libraries are:
    - `Pool`: Contains core pool functionality, such as swaps and liquidity management
    - `Hooks`: Handles the execution of hook functions
    - `Position`: Manages liquidity positions within a pool

# Core Functionality

## Pool Creation

- New pools are created by calling the `initialize` function on the `PoolManager`
- The pool creator specifies the token pair, fee tier, tick spacing, and optional hook contract address
- The `PoolManager` initializes the pool state and associates it with a unique `PoolId`

## Swaps

- Swaps are initiated through the `swap` function on the `PoolManager`, typically via a swap router contract
- The `PoolManager` executes the following steps:
    1. Checks if the pool is valid and initialized
    2. Executes the `beforeSwap` hook, if applicable
    3. Performs the actual swap, updating the pool state and charging fees
    4. Executes the `afterSwap` hook, if applicable
    5. Calculates the net token amounts owed to the user and the pool, represented by the `BalanceDelta` struct
- Swaps utilize flash accounting, where tokens are moved into the `PoolManager`, and only the final output tokens are withdrawn

## Liquidity Management

- Liquidity providers can add or remove liquidity using the `modifyLiquidity` function on the `PoolManager`. However, you wouldn't call this directly from your application, you would call this from a periphery contract to handle the locking & unlocking a particular pool. 
- The `PoolManager` executes the following steps:
    1. Checks if the pool is valid and initialized
    2. Determines if the modification is an addition or removal of liquidity
    3. Executes the appropriate `beforeAddLiquidity` or `beforeRemoveLiquidity` hook, if applicable
    4. Performs the actual liquidity modification and updates the pool state
    5. Emits the `ModifyLiquidity` event
    6. Executes the appropriate `afterAddLiquidity` or `afterRemoveLiquidity` hook, if applicable
    7. Calculates the balance delta and returns it to the caller

## Flash Accounting

- The `PoolManager` employs flash accounting to reduce gas costs and simplify multi-hop swaps
- Tokens are moved into the `PoolManager` contract, and all subsequent actions are performed within the contract's context
- Only the final output tokens are withdrawn from the `PoolManager` at the end of the transaction

# Transient Storage

- The `PoolManager` utilizes transient storage (EIP-1153) to store temporary data during complex operations
- Transient storage reduces gas costs by avoiding regular storage operations for data only needed within a single transaction
