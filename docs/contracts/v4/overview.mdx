# Uniswap V4 - Hooks

Welcome to the Uniswap V4 developer documentation.

Welcome to the Uniswap V4 developer documentation.

Uniswap V4 is designed to enhance the way liquidity is provided and tokens are traded on-chain. It aims to broaden the
scope of decentralized trading. The project welcomes community participation, providing a platform for developers and
enthusiasts to contribute to this new version of the Uniswap Protocol.

A significant feature in Uniswap V4 is the introduction of "hooks." These contracts operate at different stages in a
pool action's lifecycle, allowing for a high degree of customization.

Pool creators have the option to maintain the tradeoff decisions available in V3 or to explore new features.
Uniswap V4 pools can support dynamic fees, on-chain limit orders, or act as a time-weighted average market
maker (TWAMM) to spread large orders over time. The architecture has been updated, including a new "singleton"
contract where all pools are contained within a single smart contract, enhancing the platform's efficiency and
reducing costs.

The integration of hooks with the singleton architecture is expected to make the platform more powerful and
versatile, ensuring fast, secure, and efficient customization and routing across various pools.

Note: V4 is currently in development, and changes are ongoing in the contracts. Updates to the documentation
will be provided accordingly.
