# Introduction

Uniswap v4 introduces Subscribers, a new mechanism in v4 that allows external contracts (aka Subscribers) to be notified by the PositionManager whenever specific events occur (e.g., liquidity changes, burns). It’s especially useful for designing **liquidity incentive** systems or reward programs.

Before diving into implementation details, let's understand what makes Subscribers valuable. When a position holder subscribes their position to a Subscriber contract, that contract receives notifications about various events: liquidity changes, position burns, and subscription status changes. This flow enables protocols to accurately track and reward liquidity provision.

Subscribers become of aware of the liquidity position, without needing to own the position and its underlying capital.

# Interface Methods

Let's explore each method that a [ISubscriber](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-periphery/blob/main/src/interfaces/ISubscriber.sol) contract needs to implement. Understanding when and why these methods are called is crucial for building effective Subscriber contracts.

## Position Subscription Handling

The first two methods handle the subscription lifecycle:

```solidity
function notifySubscribe(
    uint256 tokenId,
    bytes memory data
) external;
```

This method is called whenever a position subscribes to your contract. The `tokenId` parameter identifies the subscribing position, while `data` can contain additional configuration information. 

For example, you might use this data parameter to specify:

- Lock-up duration for rewards
- Campaign-specific settings
- Custom reward parameters

> ***Note**: The data parameter is entirely optional and its interpretation is up to your implementation.*
> 

```solidity
function notifyUnsubscribe(
    uint256 tokenId
) external;
```

When a position unsubscribes, this method is called. There's an important consideration here:

> ***Important**: The gas consumption of this function must be less than unsubscribeGasLimit (set when deploying the PositionManager). This ensures users can always unsubscribe from your contract.

Also note that the subscriber contract reverts, the position will still unsuccessfully subscribe*
> 

## Position Modification Notifications

The next method handles liquidity changes and fee collection:

```solidity
function notifyModifyLiquidity(
    uint256 tokenId,
    int256 liquidityChange,
    BalanceDelta feesAccrued
) external;
```

This method is your window into position activity. It gets called in two scenarios:

- When users modify their liquidity (increase or decrease)
- When they collect accumulated fees

Here's what each parameter tells you:

- `tokenId`: The position being modified
- `liquidityChange`: How much liquidity is being added or removed (positive for additions, negative for removals)
- `feesAccrued`: Fees collected during this operation

> ***Warning**: Be cautious with feesAccrued values. In pools with a single liquidity position, malicious users can artificially inflate these values through self-donations.*
> 

## Handling Position Burns

The final method deals with position termination:

```solidity
function notifyBurn(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address owner,
    PositionInfo info,
    uint256 liquidity,
    BalanceDelta feesAccrued
) external;

```

When a position is burned (fully removed), this method provides comprehensive information about its final state:

- Who owned it (`owner`)
- Its configuration (`info`)
- How much liquidity was removed (`liquidity`)
- Any final fees collected (`feesAccrued`)

> ***Important**: When a position is burned, you'll only receive notifyBurn - there's no separate notifyModifyLiquidity call.*
> 

# How to Use Subscribers

Let's walk through the process of implementing and using a Subscriber contract. We'll break this down into four main steps that developers typically follow.

## Step 1: Implement Subscriber

First, create your contract implementing the ISubscriber interface:

```solidity

contract MySubscriber is ISubscriber {
    // Track subscribed positions
    mapping(uint256 => bool) public isSubscribed;

    // Implementation of interface methods
    function notifySubscribe(uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) external {
        // Store subscription status
        isSubscribed[tokenId] = true;
    }

    // Other required methods...
}
```

> ***Note**: This is a basic implementation. Your actual contract will need more sophisticated tracking depending on your reward mechanism.*
> 

## Step 2: Deploy Subscriber

Once implemented, deploy your contract:

```solidity
MySubscriber subscriber = new MySubscriber();
```

Make sure to store the deployed address - users will need it to subscribe their positions.

## Step 3: Mint Position

Users need positions before they can subscribe. They can either use existing positions or mint new ones:

```solidity
// Using the Position Manager
uint256 tokenId = positionManager.mint(
    poolKey,
    tickLower,
    tickUpper,
    liquidity,
    // other parameters...
);
```

## Step 4: Subscribe Position

Finally, users can subscribe their positions to your contract:

```solidity
// Optional configuration data
bytes memory subscriptionData = ""; // Configure based on your needs

// Subscribe the position
positionManager.subscribe(
    tokenId,
    subscriber,
    subscriptionData
);
```

> ***Important**: Make sure users understand any lock-up periods or conditions specified in your subscriptionData.*
> 

# Important Considerations

When implementing and deploying Subscriber contracts, there are several crucial aspects to keep in mind. Let's explore each of these to ensure your implementation is secure and efficient.

## Gas Limits and Unsubscribe Safety

The most critical consideration is the unsubscribe process:

> ***Critical**: Your notifyUnsubscribe function must consume less gas than the unsubscribeGasLimit defined in the PositionManager. This is not just a best practice - it's a fundamental safety requirement that ensures users can always exit your system.*
> 

For example:

```solidity
function notifyUnsubscribe(uint256 tokenId) external {
    // Keep this function lightweight
    delete positionData[tokenId]; // Simple state cleanup
    emit PositionUnsubscribed(tokenId);
}
```

## Implementation Patterns

When building your Subscriber, follow these established patterns:

### Liquidity Tracking

It's essential to properly track liquidity changes:

- Use `notifyModifyLiquidity` to update your internal accounting
- Remember that positive changes mean liquidity is being added
- Account for negative changes when liquidity is removed

> ***Note**: During a position burn, you'll only receive notifyBurn - there won't be a separate notifyModifyLiquidity call.*
> 

### Optional Data Handling

The `optionalData` parameter in subscriptions can be used for:

- Additional campaign configuration
- Lock-up duration specifications
- Other custom parameters

## Security Considerations

Since Subscriber contracts often handle value distribution, security is paramount:

### Value Distribution

- **Custody**: Implement secure mechanisms for handling reward tokens
- **Calculation**: Ensure reward calculations are accurate and cannot be manipulated

### Protection Against Exploitation

Be aware of potential attack vectors:

- Users can artificially inflate `feesAccrued` in single-position pools
- Malicious actors might attempt to claim rewards they haven't earned

> ***Warning**: Always validate inputs and implement thorough checks before distributing any value.*
> 

# Implementation Example

Let’s build a **minimal** Subscriber implementation that demonstrates how to handle position events. In practice, you’d likely extend these concepts to include reward calculations or more complex accounting.

> ***Note**: The code below focuses on the essential mechanics of receiving notifications. A production system will need additional logic for security, reward distribution, and user interaction.*
> 

## Basic Reward Tracking

First, we set up our contract with the necessary data structures and references:

```solidity
contract LiquidityRewardsSubscriber is ISubscriber {
    // 1) Store subscription timestamps and liquidity for each position
    struct PositionData {
        uint256 subscriptionTime;
        uint256 currentLiquidity;
        bool isSubscribed;
    }

    // 2) A mapping from tokenId (position NFT) to our custom tracking data
    mapping(uint256 => PositionData) public positions;

    // 3) Reference to the PositionManager so we can authenticate notifications
    IPositionManager public immutable positionManager;

    constructor(IPositionManager _positionManager) {
        positionManager = _positionManager;
    }
}

```

### Why This Matters

- **`PositionData`**: Tracks how long the position has been subscribed (`subscriptionTime`), how much liquidity it currently has (`currentLiquidity`), and whether it’s active (`isSubscribed`).
- **`positionManager`**: We only trust calls from this authorized contract, preventing anyone else from triggering notifications.

## Handling Subscription Events

Next, we implement `notifySubscribe` and `notifyUnsubscribe` to manage a position’s subscription status:

```solidity
		/// @notice Handle new position subscriptions
		function notifySubscribe(
		    uint256 tokenId,
		    bytes memory /* data */
		) external {
		    require(msg.sender == address(positionManager), "Unauthorized");
		
		    positions[tokenId] = PositionData({
		        subscriptionTime: block.timestamp,
		        currentLiquidity: 0,
		        isSubscribed: true
		    });
		}
		
		/// @notice Clean up on unsubscribe
		/// @dev Keep this minimal to respect unsubscribeGasLimit
		function notifyUnsubscribe(uint256 tokenId) external {
		    require(msg.sender == address(positionManager), "Unauthorized");
		
		    // Remove all stored data for unsubscribed positions
		    delete positions[tokenId];
		}
```

### Key Takeaways

- We store the current block timestamp on `notifySubscribe` to measure how long a position has been subscribed.
- The `notifyUnsubscribe` method is deliberately small to ensure it remains below the `unsubscribeGasLimit`.

## Listening for Liquidity Modifications

Positions can add or remove liquidity, and potentially collect fees during the same transaction:

```solidity
/// @notice Track liquidity changes or fee collections
function notifyModifyLiquidity(
    uint256 tokenId,
    int256 liquidityChange,
    BalanceDelta /* feesAccrued */
) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(positionManager), "Unauthorized");

    PositionData storage position = positions[tokenId];

    if (liquidityChange > 0) {
        // Positive value indicates added liquidity
        position.currentLiquidity += uint256(liquidityChange);
    } else if (liquidityChange < 0) {
        // Negative value indicates removed liquidity
        position.currentLiquidity -= uint256(-liquidityChange);
    }
}
```

### Why This Is Important

- **`liquidityChange`** can be positive (liquidity added) or negative (liquidity removed). We update our internal tracking accordingly.
- **`feesAccrued`** is provided if the user also collects fees during this action. In a more advanced version, you could track these fees for reward calculations.

## Processing Position Burns

When a position is completely removed (burned), Uniswap v4 calls `notifyBurn`:

```solidity
/// @notice Called when a position is fully removed
function notifyBurn(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address,
    PositionInfo,
    uint256,
    BalanceDelta
) external {
    require(msg.sender == address(positionManager), "Unauthorized");

    // The position no longer exists, so remove our records
    delete positions[tokenId];
}
```

### Important Distinction

- **No `notifyModifyLiquidity`** is triggered on a full burn—`notifyBurn` covers any final liquidity/fee changes.

## Using the Subscriber

To put this into practice:

```solidity
// 1. Deploy the subscriber
LiquidityRewardsSubscriber subscriber = new LiquidityRewardsSubscriber(positionManager);

// 2. Users then subscribe their positions
positionManager.subscribe(tokenId, subscriber, "");

```

- **Deployment**: The developer deploying the Subscriber contract must store its address and share it with users.
- **Subscription**: Users call `subscribe(...)` on the PositionManager, passing in the `tokenId` and the subscriber’s address (yours).

## Production Considerations

> This example is deliberately minimal. A real-world Subscriber would need:
> 
> - **Reward Distribution**: Logic that calculates and distributes incentives based on `subscriptionTime`, `currentLiquidity`, or `feesAccrued`.
> - **Security Checks**: Safeguards against malicious actors who might inflate fees, manipulate liquidity changes, or spam subscribe/unsubscribe cycles.
> - **Access Control**: Roles or permissions if only certain addresses are allowed to manage rewards or update parameters.
> - **Gas Optimization**: Especially if you expect many positions to subscribe/unsubscribe frequently.
