title: Mint Position
---

Similar to Uniswap v3, liquidity positions are minted as ERC-721 tokens and depend on a *periphery* contract.
v4's `PositionManager` contract will facilitate liquidity management

### Context

Please note that `PositionManager` is a command-based contract, where integrators will be encoding commands and their corresponding
parameters.

### Setup

See the [setup guide](./00-setup-liquidity.mdx)

# Guide

Below is a step-by-step guide for minting a v4 liquidity position, in *solidity*

### 1. Import and define `IPositionManager`

```solidity
import {IPositionManager} from "v4-periphery/src/interfaces/IPositionManager.sol";

// inside a contract, test, or foundry script:
IPositionManager posm = IPositionManager(<address>);
```

### 2. Encode Actions

To mint a position, two actions are required:

* mint operation - the creation of the liquidity position
* settle pair - the two tokens to be paid by msg.sender

```solidity
import {Actions} from "v4-periphery/src/libraries/Actions.sol";

bytes memory actions = abi.encodePacked(Actions.MINT_POSITION, Actions.SETTLE_PAIR);
```

### 3. Encode Parameters

```solidity
bytes[] memory params = new bytes[](2);
```

The `MINT_POSITION` action requires the following parameters:

| Parameter    | Type      | Description                                                    |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `poolKey`    | _PoolKey_ | where the liquidity will be added to                           |
| `tickLower`  | _int24_   | the lower tick boundary of the position                        |
| `tickUpper`  | _int24_   | the upper tick boundary of the position                        |
| `liquidity`  | _uint256_ | the amount of liquidity units to mint                          |
| `amount0Max` | _uint128_ | the maximum amount of currency0 msg.sender is willing to pay   |
| `amount1Max` | _uint128_ | the maximum amount of currency1 msg.sender is willing to pay   |
| `recipient`  | _address_ | the address that will receive the liquidity position (ERC-721) |
| `hookData`   | _bytes_   | arbitrary data that will be forwarded to hook functions        |

```solidity
params[0] = abi.encode(poolKey, tickLower, tickUpper, liquidity, amount0Max, amount1Max, recipient, hookData);
```

The `SETTLE_PAIR` action requires the following parameters:

* `currency0` - _Currency_, one of the tokens to be paid by msg.sender
* `currency1` - _Currency_, the other token to be paid by msg.sender

```solidity
params[1] = abi.encode(currency0, currency1);
```

### 4. Submit Call

The entrypoint for all liquidity operations is `modifyLiquidities()`

```solidity
uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 60;

posm.modifyLiquidities(
    abi.encode(actions, params),
    deadline
);
```

## Additional notes:

* To obtain balance changes, callers should read token balances before and after the `.modifyLiquidities()` call
