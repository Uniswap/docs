title: LiquidityAmounts
---

The `LiquidityAmounts` library provides functions for computing liquidity amounts from token amounts and prices in Uniswap V4.

# Key Concept: sqrtPriceX96

`sqrtPriceX96` represents the square root of the price ratio of token1 to token0, multiplied by 2^96. This representation allows for precise price calculations across a wide range of values while using fixed-point arithmetic. It's more efficient than using ticks for intermediate calculations, as it avoids frequent conversions between prices and ticks.

# Functions

## getLiquidityForAmount0

```solidity
function getLiquidityForAmount0(uint160 sqrtPriceAX96, uint160 sqrtPriceBX96, uint256 amount0)
internal
pure
returns (uint128 liquidity)
```

Computes the amount of liquidity received for a given amount of token0 and price range.

| Param Name     | Type    | Description                                   |
|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| sqrtPriceAX96  | uint160 | Square root of price at first tick boundary   |
| sqrtPriceBX96  | uint160 | Square root of price at second tick boundary  |
| amount0        | uint256 | The amount of token0 being sent in            |

Returns the amount of liquidity received.

## getLiquidityForAmount1

```solidity
function getLiquidityForAmount1(uint160 sqrtPriceAX96, uint160 sqrtPriceBX96, uint256 amount1)
internal
pure
returns (uint128 liquidity)
```

Computes the amount of liquidity received for a given amount of token1 and price range.

```

Computes the maximum amount of liquidity received for given amounts of token0 and token1, the current pool prices, and the prices at the tick boundaries.

| amount0        | uint256 | The amount of token0 being sent in            |
| amount1        | uint256 | The amount of token1 being sent in            |

Returns the maximum amount of liquidity received.

## getAmount0ForLiquidity

```solidity
function getAmount0ForLiquidity(uint160 sqrtPriceAX96, uint160 sqrtPriceBX96, uint128 liquidity)
internal
pure
returns (uint256 amount0)
```

Computes the amount of token0 for a given amount of liquidity and a price range.

| Param Name     | Type    | Description                                   |
|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| sqrtPriceAX96  | uint160 | Square root of price at first tick boundary   |
| sqrtPriceBX96  | uint160 | Square root of price at second tick boundary  |
| liquidity      | uint128 | The liquidity being valued                    |

Returns the amount of token0.

## getAmount1ForLiquidity

```solidity
function getAmount1ForLiquidity(uint160 sqrtPriceAX96, uint160 sqrtPriceBX96, uint128 liquidity)
internal
pure
returns (uint256 amount1)
```

Computes the amount of token1 for a given amount of liquidity and a price range.

| Param Name     | Type    | Description                                   |
|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
