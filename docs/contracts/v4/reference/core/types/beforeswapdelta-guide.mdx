title: BeforeSwapDelta Guide
---

`BeforeSwapDelta` is a custom type used in Uniswap V4 hook contracts to represent balance changes during swap operations. It is specifically designed to handle the return value of the `beforeSwap` hook and to be compatible with the `afterSwap` hook.

Before explaining `BeforeSwapDelta` in detail, it is worth noting that in the context of Uniswap V4 swaps:

- The **specified** token is the one for which the user specifies an exact input or output amount.
- The **unspecified** token is the counterpart in the swap, whose amount is determined by the pool's pricing mechanism.

# Purpose

The main purpose of `BeforeSwapDelta` is to efficiently encode and decode balance changes for both specified and unspecified tokens in a single 256-bit value. This compact representation allows for gas-efficient operations and seamless integration with Uniswap V4's hook system.

`BeforeSwapDelta` is essential for:

- Allowing hooks to modify swap parameters or override default swap behavior
- Allowing hooks to take fees from swaps
- Providing fine-grained control over balance adjustments resulting from swaps
- Optimizing gas usage by packing two `int128` values into a single `int256`

To summarise, `BeforeSwapDelta` is used to ensure that the net balance change for each token is zero after the hook's functionality is executed. This is important for maintaining the integrity of the pool's balances and ensuring that the hooks do not introduce any unexpected or unauthorized balance changes.

# Type Definition

```solidity
type BeforeSwapDelta is int256;
```

The `BeforeSwapDelta` type is an alias for int256, where:

- The upper 128 bits represent the delta in specified tokens
- The lower 128 bits represent the delta in unspecified tokens

# Using Directives

```solidity
using BeforeSwapDeltaLibrary for BeforeSwapDelta global;
using SafeCast for int256;
```

These using directives enable library functions to be used directly on `BeforeSwapDelta` values and provide safe casting operations for int256 values.

# Functions

## toBeforeSwapDelta

```solidity
function toBeforeSwapDelta(int128 deltaSpecified, int128 deltaUnspecified) pure returns (BeforeSwapDelta beforeSwapDelta);
```

Creates a `BeforeSwapDelta` value from two `int128` values representing `deltaSpecified` and `deltaUnspecified`.

| Param Name | Type    | Description                          |
|------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| deltaSpecified    | int128  | The balance change for the specified token       |
| deltaUnspecified    | int128  | The balance change for the unspecified token      |

Returns the created `BeforeSwapDelta` value.

This function uses bitwise operations in assembly for gas-efficient packing of the two int128 values:

```solidity
assembly ("memory-safe") {
    beforeSwapDelta := or(shl(128, deltaSpecified), and(sub(shl(128, 1), 1), deltaUnspecified))
}
```

# Library Functions

## ZERO_DELTA

```solidity
BeforeSwapDelta public constant ZERO_DELTA = BeforeSwapDelta.wrap(0);
```

A constant representing a zero delta (no balance changes). It should be used as a default return value. It is most commonly used for hooks that are *not* implementing custom accounting.

## getSpecifiedDelta

```solidity
function getSpecifiedDelta(BeforeSwapDelta delta) internal pure returns (int128 deltaSpecified);
```

Extracts the specified token delta from a `BeforeSwapDelta` value.

| Param Name | Type         | Description                          |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| delta      | BeforeSwapDelta | The `BeforeSwapDelta` value       |

Returns the extracted specified token delta as an `int128`.

## getUnspecifiedDelta

```solidity
function getUnspecifiedDelta(BeforeSwapDelta delta) internal pure returns (int128 deltaUnspecified);
```

Extracts the unspecified token delta from a BeforeSwapDelta value.

| Param Name | Type         | Description                          |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| delta          | BeforeSwapDelta | The `BeforeSwapDelta`       |

Returns the extracted unspecified token delta as an `int128`.

# Usage in Hooks

When a hook is called during a swap operation, it can perform custom logic and interact with the pool's balances. The `beforeSwap` hook returns a `BeforeSwapDelta` value to indicate any balance changes the *hook* introduces. For example, hooks taking fees should return the value it took as a `BeforeSwapDelta`.

# Usage in PoolManager.sol

`BeforeSwapDelta` plays a crucial role in Uniswap V4's PoolManager contract, particularly in the swap process. Here's an overview of how it's used:

## Calling the `beforeSwap` Hook

In the `swap` function of the PoolManager contract, the `beforeSwap` hook is called:

```solidity
function swap(PoolKey memory key, IPoolManager.SwapParams memory params, bytes calldata hookData)
    // ...
    returns (BalanceDelta swapDelta)
{
    // ... (other code)

    BeforeSwapDelta beforeSwapDelta;
    {
        int256 amountToSwap;
        uint24 lpFeeOverride;
        (amountToSwap, beforeSwapDelta, lpFeeOverride) = key.hooks.beforeSwap(key, params, hookData);

        // ... (swap execution)
    }

    // ... (other code)
}
```

The `beforeSwap` hook returns a `BeforeSwapDelta` value along with other parameters.

## Interaction between `beforeSwapDelta` and `amountToSwap`

The `beforeSwapDelta` returned by the hook is used in conjunction with `params.amountSpecified` to determine the final `amountToSwap`. This allows hooks to modify the swap amount based on their custom logic. Here's a more detailed explanation of how this works:

1. The `beforeSwap` hook returns a `BeforeSwapDelta` value.
2. The `getSpecifiedDelta()` of this `BeforeSwapDelta` is used to adjust the original `params.amountSpecified`.
3. This adjustment results in the final `amountToSwap` that will be used for the actual swap operation.

Here's a simplified representation of this calculation:

```solidity
int256 amountToSwap = params.amountSpecified + beforeSwapDelta.getSpecifiedDelta();
```

In this example, the `amountToSwap` is calculated by adding the specified delta from `beforeSwapDelta` to the original `amountSpecified`. This calculation allows hooks to increase or decrease the swap amount, effectively implementing features like fees, rebates, or other custom logic.

**Detailed Example:**

Let's say a user wants to swap 100 tokens, but a hook implements a 1% fee:

1. `params.amountSpecified` would be 100
2. The hook calculates the fee as 1 token and returns a `beforeSwapDelta` with a specified delta of -1
3. `amountToSwap` is then calculated as 100 + (-1) = 99

This way, the actual amount swapped (99) reflects the fee taken by the hook, while still allowing the pool to execute the swap based on the original 100 token input from the user.

Here's how the `beforeSwap` hook might handle this:

```solidity
function _beforeSwap(
    address,
    PoolKey calldata,
    IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params,
    bytes calldata
) internal override returns (int256 amountIn, BeforeSwapDelta delta, uint24) {
    int128 specifiedAmount = params.amountSpecified.toInt128();
    int128 fee = specifiedAmount / 100;  // 1% fee
    int128 adjustedAmount = specifiedAmount - fee;
    
    delta = BeforeSwapDelta.from(-fee, 0);  // Fee taken from specified token
    amountIn = params.amountSpecified;  // Original amount
    
    return (amountIn, delta, 0);
}
```

After this hook executes:

- `amountIn` remains 100 (the original `params.amountSpecified`)
- `delta` represents a change of -1 in the specified token (the fee)

Then, in the PoolManager:

```solidity
int256 amountToSwap = params.amountSpecified + beforeSwapDelta.getSpecifiedDelta();
// This effectively calculates: 100 + (-1) = 99
```

As a result:

- The pool sees the full input amount of 100 tokens.
- The actual amount swapped is 99 tokens.
- The 1 token difference becomes the hook's fee.

This mechanism allows hooks to influence the swap amount while maintaining transparency about the full input amount, enabling complex custom logic within the Uniswap V4 framework.

## Relation to `afterSwap`

While `beforeSwapDelta` is primarily used in the `beforeSwap` hook, it also plays a role in the `afterSwap` process. Specifically:

- The `afterSwap` hook receives the `beforeSwapDelta` as a parameter.
- The unspecified delta (`beforeSwapDelta.getUnspecifiedDelta()`) is particularly important in the `afterSwap` context.
- This unspecified delta is accounted for in `afterSwap`'s calculations, allowing for consistent balance tracking across the entire swap process.

This mechanism ensures that:

1. Changes made by the `beforeSwap` hook are properly considered when finalizing the swap.
2. The `afterSwap` hook can make informed decisions based on the full context of the swap, including any modifications made in `beforeSwap`.
3. Complex swap logic can be implemented across multiple hook points while maintaining consistency.

For example, if a fee was taken on the specified token in `beforeSwap`, the `afterSwap` hook can use this information to ensure the overall balance changes are correct, potentially adjusting the unspecified token amount accordingly.

Developers implementing custom hooks should be aware of this relationship and ensure their `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` implementations work together coherently, especially when implementing features like fees or rebates that affect token balances.

# Key Purposes of BeforeSwapDelta

The `BeforeSwapDelta` serves several important purposes in the Uniswap V4 swap process:

1. **Customization of Swap Behavior:** It allows hooks to modify the swap parameters or even completely override the default swap behavior.
2. **Balance Adjustment:** The delta values can be used to adjust the final balance changes resulting from the swap, giving hooks fine-grained control over the swap's outcome.
3. **Gas Optimization:** By packing two `int128` values into a single `int256`, it reduces the number of stack variables and can lead to gas savings.
4. **Cross-Hook Communication:** It provides a way for the `beforeSwap` hook to pass information to the `afterSwap` hook, enabling more complex and stateful hook logic.
5. **Hook Fees Implementation:** `BeforeSwapDelta` offers flexible options for implementing hook fees:

- Fees can be charged on either the specified or unspecified token.
- Fees can be implemented in either the `beforeSwap` or `afterSwap` hook.
- For `beforeSwap`:

1. Adjust the specified amount to account for the fee.
2. Useful for scenarios where the fee needs to be known before the swap execution.


- For `afterSwap`:

1. Generally considered best practice to charge fees on the unspecified token.
2. Allows for more accurate fee calculation based on the actual swap outcome.

- As a result, developers can implement various fee structures, such as:

1. Fixed fee amounts
2. Percentage-based fees
3. Tiered fee structures based on swap volume or other criteria

Example of a simple percentage-based fee in `beforeSwap`:

```solidity
int128 fee = specifiedAmount * FEE_PERCENTAGE / 100;
int128 adjustedAmount = specifiedAmount - fee;
delta = BeforeSwapDelta.from(-adjustedAmount, 0);
```

This flexibility in fee implementation allows developers to create sophisticated economic models within their Uniswap V4 hooks, tailoring the behavior to specific use cases while maintaining the efficiency and standardization provided by the `BeforeSwapDelta` structure.

# Perspective

It's important to note that the `BeforeSwapDelta` is from the perspective of the hook itself, not the user. For example, if a user swaps 1 USDC for 1 USDT:

- User gives 1 USDC: balance0OfUser decreases
- Hook gets 1 USDC: balance0OfHook increases

This perspective is key to correctly interpreting and manipulating the delta values within hook implementations.

# Implementation Details

The `BeforeSwapDelta` type and its associated functions use low-level assembly code for efficient bit manipulation and gas optimization:

- The `toBeforeSwapDelta` function uses bitwise operations (`shl`, `or`, `and`, `sub`) to pack two `int128` values into a single `int256`.
- The `getSpecifiedDelta` function uses the `sar` (shift arithmetic right) operation to extract the upper 128 bits.
- The `getUnspecifiedDelta` function uses the `signextend` operation to extract and sign-extend the lower 128 bits.

The `toBeforeSwapDelta` function combines the specified and unspecified deltas into a single `int256` value using bitwise operations. The `getSpecifiedDelta` and `getUnspecifiedDelta` functions extract the respective deltas using bit shifting and sign extension.

By leveraging this compact representation and efficient arithmetic operations, Uniswap V4 can perform complex balance calculations and updates in a gas-optimized manner, reducing the overall cost of executing pool-related operations.

# Implementation Considerations

When working with `BeforeSwapDelta`, especially for implementing hook fees, consider the following:

- **Fee Timing:** While fees can be implemented in either `beforeSwap` or `afterSwap`, charging fees on the unspecified token in `afterSwap` is often considered best practice. This approach can provide more accurate fee calculations based on the final swap amounts.
- **Fee Direction:** Remember that the deltas in `BeforeSwapDelta` are from the perspective of the hook. A positive delta means the hook is receiving tokens, while a negative delta means the hook is paying out tokens.
- **Consistency:** Ensure that your fee implementation is consistent across both `beforeSwap` and `afterSwap` hooks to maintain the integrity of the swap process.
- **Gas Efficiency:** When implementing fees, consider the gas costs of your calculations. The compact nature of `BeforeSwapDelta` can help in optimizing gas usage, but complex fee structures might increase gas costs.

# Comparison with BalanceDelta

`BeforeSwapDelta` shares a similar structure with `BalanceDelta`, both packing two `int128` values into a single `int256`. However, there are key differences:

- `BalanceDelta` represents amount0 and amount1.
- `BeforeSwapDelta` represents specified and unspecified amounts, which may not directly correspond to token0 and token1, depending on the swap direction.

# Best Practices

When working with `BeforeSwapDelta`, consider the following best practices:

- Always use the provided library functions (`getSpecifiedDelta` and `getUnspecifiedDelta`) to extract delta values.
- Ensure that the signs of the delta values are correct from the hook's perspective.
- Use `SafeCast` when converting between different integer types to prevent overflow/underflow errors.

# Error Handling and Edge Cases

- **Overflow/Underflow:** Ensure that the input int128 values do not exceed their range when packing into BeforeSwapDelta.
- **Zero Values:** ZERO_DELTA represents no balance changes. Be cautious when interpreting zero values in specific contexts.
- **Sign Mismatch:** Ensure that the signs of the delta values correctly represent the intended balance changes from the hook's perspective.

# Example Usage in a Hook

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example of how `BeforeSwapDelta` might be used in a `beforeSwap` hook:

```solidity
function _beforeSwap(
    address,
    PoolKey calldata,
    IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params,
    bytes calldata
) internal override returns (int256 amountIn, BeforeSwapDelta delta, uint24) {
    // Convert the specified amount to int128
    int128 specifiedAmount = params.amountSpecified.toInt128();
    
    // In this example, we're not modifying the unspecified amount
    int128 unspecifiedAmount = 0; // Calculated based on your custom logic
    
    // Create the BeforeSwapDelta
    delta = toBeforeSwapDelta(specifiedAmount, unspecifiedAmount);
    
    // Return the original amount as amountIn
    amountIn = params.amountSpecified;
    
    // Return 0 for lpFeeOverride as we're not changing the LP fee
    return (amountIn, delta, 0);
}
```

Let's break down what this basic hook is doing:

1. It converts the `params.amountSpecified` to `int128`, which is required for `BeforeSwapDelta`.
2. It sets the `unspecifiedAmount` to 0, which means this hook isn't modifying the counterpart token in the swap.
3. It creates a `BeforeSwapDelta` using these amounts.
4. It returns the original `amountIn`, the created `delta`, and 0 for `lpFeeOverride`.

This basic example doesn't modify the swap parameters or introduce any fees. It demonstrates the minimal structure of a `beforeSwap` hook using `BeforeSwapDelta`.

## Advanced Example: Implementing a Fee

For a more practical use case, here's an example that implements a simple fee mechanism:

```solidity
function _beforeSwap(
    address,
    PoolKey calldata key,
    IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params,
    bytes calldata
) internal override returns (int256 amountIn, BeforeSwapDelta delta, uint24) {
    // Determine if this is a swap for token0 or token1
    bool zeroForOne = params.zeroForOne;
    
    // Convert the specified amount to int128, ensuring it's positive
    int128 specifiedAmount = params.amountSpecified.abs().toInt128();
    
    // Calculate a 0.1% fee
    int128 fee = specifiedAmount / 1000;
    
    // Adjust the specified amount based on swap direction
    int128 adjustedSpecifiedAmount;
    if (params.exactInput) {
        // For exact input, reduce the amount by the fee
        adjustedSpecifiedAmount = specifiedAmount - fee;
    } else {
        // For exact output, increase the amount by the fee
        adjustedSpecifiedAmount = specifiedAmount + fee;
    }
    
    // Create the BeforeSwapDelta
    delta = zeroForOne 
        ? BeforeSwapDelta.from(-adjustedSpecifiedAmount, 0)
        : BeforeSwapDelta.from(0, -adjustedSpecifiedAmount);
    
    // Return the original amount as amountIn
    amountIn = params.amountSpecified;
    
    // Return 0 for lpFeeOverride as we're not changing the LP fee
    return (amountIn, delta, 0);
}
```

**Let's break down what this hook is doing:**

1. **Swap Direction Determination:**
   The hook checks `params.zeroForOne` to determine the direction of the swap (token0 to token1 or vice versa).
2. **Amount Conversion:** It converts `params.amountSpecified` to a positive `int128`. This is necessary because `BeforeSwapDelta` works with `int128` values.
3. **Fee Calculation:** A 0.1% fee is calculated based on the specified amount.
4. **Amount Adjustment:** Depending on whether the swap is exact input or exact output, the specified amount is adjusted:
   - For exact input, the fee is subtracted (user provides less to the pool).
   - For exact output, the fee is added (user needs to provide more to the pool).
5. **BeforeSwapDelta Creation:** The `BeforeSwapDelta` is created using the adjusted amount. The negative sign indicates that the pool will receive these tokens from the user. The amount is placed in either the first or second parameter of `BeforeSwapDelta.from()` depending on the swap direction.
6. **Return Values:**
   - `amountIn` is set to the original `params.amountSpecified`. This allows the pool to account for the full amount the user is putting in or expecting out.
   - The `delta` value contains our adjusted amounts.
   - `0` is returned for `lpFeeOverride`, meaning we're not changing the default LP fee.

**What This Accomplishes:**

- This hook implements a 0.1% fee on the swaps.
- It handles both exact input and exact output swaps correctly.
- It accounts for the swap direction (token0 to token1 or vice versa).
- The fee is taken from the input amount for exact input swaps, or added to the input amount for exact output swaps.
- The pool will see the full input/output amount, but will only swap the adjusted amount (after accounting for the fee).
- The difference between the original amount and the adjusted amount effectively becomes the hook's fee.

**Considerations:**

- This example assumes the fee is always taken in the input token. In practice, you might want to design more sophisticated fee structures.
- The hook doesn't handle storage of collected fees. In a real implementation, you'd need to account for and possibly transfer these fees.
- Always ensure that your hook's logic is consistent with the overall pool behavior and doesn't introduce unexpected side effects.
- This implementation doesn't change the LP fee (lpFeeOverride is 0). In some cases, you might want to adjust this as well.

As you can see from this example, by using `BeforeSwapDelta`, hooks can implement custom logic such as fees, rebates, or other modifications to the swap parameters, allowing for highly flexible and customizable pool behavior in Uniswap V4.
