`PoolKey` is a crucial struct in Uniswap V4 that uniquely identifies a liquidity pool. It encapsulates all the essential parameters that define a pool's characteristics.

## Structure

```solidity
struct PoolKey {
    Currency currency0;
    Currency currency1;
    uint24 fee;
    int24 tickSpacing;
    IHooks hooks;
}
```

## Fields

| Field Name  | Type     | Description                                                                            |
|-------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| currency0   | Currency | The lower currency of the pool, sorted numerically                                     |
| currency1   | Currency | The higher currency of the pool, sorted numerically                                    |
| fee         | uint24   | The pool swap fee, capped at 1,000,000. If the first bit is 1, the pool has a dynamic fee |
| tickSpacing | int24    | The spacing between ticks for the pool                                                 |
| hooks       | IHooks   | The address of the hooks contract associated with the pool                             |

## Important Notes

- The `currency0` and `currency1` fields are always sorted numerically, with `currency0` being the lower value. This ensures consistent pool identification regardless of the order in which tokens are provided.
- The `fee` field can represent either a static fee or indicate that the pool uses a dynamic fee mechanism.
- The `tickSpacing` field determines the granularity of price ranges that can be used for liquidity provision.
- The `hooks` field is an interface of our Hooks that the PoolManager uses to call these functions
