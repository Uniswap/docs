# Setup

For users looking to interact with the canonical Uniswap v4 `PositionManager`, _v4-periphery_ is a required dependency

Currently, developing with Uniswap v4 _requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)_

## Quickstart

_Use [v4-template](https://github.com/new?template_name=v4-template&template_owner=uniswapfoundation)_, which has pre-configured dependencies and tests for Uniswap v4

Clone the repository made from _v4-template_
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>
```

Install dependencies
```bash
forge install
```
