title: Create Pool
---

## Context

Creating a pool on Uniswap v4 is permissionless and enables the trading of an asset. Uniswap v4 is a popular destination for creating markets due to its:

* Proven track record and battle-tested codebase
* Concentrated liquidity, unlocking capital efficiency
* Flexibile pool design through dynamic fees and hooks
* Gas-efficient architecture
* Integrations with alternative trading venues

For more information, developers should see [Uniswap v4 Overview](/contracts/v4/overview)

The guide covers two approaches to creating a pool:
1. Create a pool only
2. Create a pool and add initial liquidity, with one transaction

### Setup

Developing with Uniswap v4 _requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)_

Install the dependencies:
```bash
forge install uniswap/v4-core
forge install uniswap/v4-periphery
```

## Guide: Create a Pool Only

To initialize a Uniswap v4 Pool _without initial liquidity_, developers should call [`PoolManager.initialize()`](/contracts/v4/reference/core/interfaces/IPoolManager#initialize)

Creating a pool without liquidity may be useful for "reserving" a pool for future use, when initial liquidity is not available, or when external market makers would provide the starting liquidity

### 1. Configure the Pool

```solidity
import {PoolKey} from "v4-core/src/types/PoolKey.sol";

PoolKey memory pool = PoolKey({
    currency0: currency0,
    currency1: currency1,
    fee: lpFee,
    tickSpacing: tickSpacing,
    hooks: hookContract
});
```
> For native token pairs (Ether), use `CurrencyLibrary.ADDRESS_ZERO` as `currency0`

[PoolKey](/contracts/v4/reference/core/types/PoolKey) uniquely identifies a pool

* _Currencies_ should be sorted, `uint160(currency0) < uint160(currency1)`
* _lpFee_ is the fee expressed in pips, i.e. 3000 = 0.30%
* _tickSpacing_ is the granularity of the pool. Lower values are more precise but may be more expensive to trade on
* _hookContract_ is the address of the hook contract

A note on `tickSpacing`:

Lower tick spacing provides improved price precision; however, smaller tick spaces will cause swaps to cross ticks more often, incurring higher gas costs

As a reference, Uniswap v3 pools are configured with:

| Fee   | Fee Value | Tick Spacing |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 0.01% | 100       | 1            |
| 0.05% | 500       | 10           |
| 0.30% | 3000      | 60           |
| 1.00% | 10_000    | 200          |

### 2. Call `initialize`
Pools are initialized with a starting price
```solidity
IPoolManager(manager).initialize(pool, startingPrice);
```   
* the _startingPrice_ is expressed as sqrtPriceX96: `floor(sqrt(token1 / token0) * 2^96)`
    - i.e. `79228162514264337593543950336` is the starting price for a 1:1 pool

## Guide: Create a Pool & Add Liquidity
Uniswap v4's `PositionManager` supports atomic creation of a pool and initial liquidity using [_multicall_](/contracts/v4/reference/periphery/base/Multicall_v4). Developers can create a trading pool, with liquidity, in a single transaction:

### 1. Initialize the parameters provided to `multicall()`
```solidity
bytes[] memory params = new bytes[](2);
```
* The first call, `params[0]`, will encode `initializePool` parameters
* The second call, `params[1]`, will encode a _mint_ operation for `modifyLiquidities`

### 2. Configure the pool
```solidity
PoolKey memory pool = PoolKey({
    currency0: currency0,
    currency1: currency1,
    fee: lpFee,
    tickSpacing: tickSpacing,
    hooks: hookContract
});
```
> For native token pairs (Ether), use `CurrencyLibrary.ADDRESS_ZERO` as `currency0`

[PoolKey](/contracts/v4/reference/core/types/PoolKey) uniquely identifies a pool
* _Currencies_ should be sorted, `uint160(currency0) < uint160(currency1)`
* _lpFee_ is the fee expressed in pips, i.e. 3000 = 0.30%
* _tickSpacing_ is the granularity of the pool. Lower values are more precise but more expensive to trade
* _hookContract_ is the address of the hook contract

### 3. Encode the [`initializePool`](/contracts/v4/reference/periphery/base/PoolInitializer) parameters
Pools are initialized with a starting price
```solidity
params[0] = abi.encodeWithSelector(
    PositionManager.initializePool.selector,
    pool,
    startingPrice
);
```
* the _startingPrice_ is expressed as _sqrtPriceX96_: `floor(sqrt(token1 / token0) * 2^96)`
    - `79228162514264337593543950336` is the starting price for a 1:1 pool

### 4. Initialize the _mint-liquidity_ parameters    
PositionManager's `modifyLiquidities` uses an encoded command system
```solidity
bytes memory actions = abi.encodePacked(uint8(Actions.MINT_POSITION), uint8(Actions.SETTLE_PAIR));
```
* The first command `MINT_POSITION` creates a new liquidity position
* The second command `SETTLE_PAIR` indicates that tokens are to be paid by the caller, to create the position

### 5. Encode the `MINT_POSITION` parameters
```solidity
bytes[] memory mintParams = new bytes[](2);
mintParams[0] = abi.encode(pool, tickLower, tickUpper, liquidity, amount0Max, amount1Max, recipient, hookData);
```
* _pool_ the same `PoolKey` defined above, in pool-creation
* _tickLower_ and _tickUpper_ are the range of the position, must be a multiple of `pool.tickSpacing`
* _liquidity_ is the amount of liquidity units to add, see `LiquidityAmounts` for converting token amounts to liquidity units
* _amount0Max_ and _amount1Max_ are the maximum amounts of token0 and token1 the caller is willing to transfer
* _recipient_ is the address that will receive the liquidity position (ERC-721)
* _hookData_ is the optional hook data

### 6. Encode the `SETTLE_PAIR` parameters
    Creating a position on a pool requires the caller to transfer `currency0` and `currency1` tokens
```solidity
mintParams[1] = abi.encode(pool.currency0, pool.currency1);
```

### 7. Encode the [`modifyLiquidites`](/contracts/v4/reference/periphery/PositionManager#modifyliquidities) call
```solidity
uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 60;
params[1] = abi.encodeWithSelector(
    posm.modifyLiquidities.selector, abi.encode(actions, mintParams), deadline
);
```

### 8. Approve the tokens
`PositionManager` uses `Permit2` for token transfers
* Repeat for both tokens
```solidity
// approve permit2 as a spender
IERC20(token).approve(address(permit2), type(uint256).max);

// approve `PositionManager` as a spender
IAllowanceTransfer(address(permit2)).approve(token, address(positionManager), type(uint160).max, type(uint48).max);
```

### 9. Execute the multicall
The `multicall` is used to execute multiple calls in a single transaction
```solidity
PositionManager(posm).multicall(params);
```
For pools paired with native tokens (Ether), provide `value` in the contract call
```solidity
PositionManager(posm).multicall{value: ethToSend}(params);
```
> Excess Ether is **NOT** refunded unless developers encoded `SWEEP` in the `actions` parameter
