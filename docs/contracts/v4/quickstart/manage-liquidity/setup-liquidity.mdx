For users looking to interact with the canonical Uniswap v4 `PositionManager`, _v4-periphery_ is a required dependency

Currently, developing with Uniswap v4 _requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)_

## Quickstart

_Use [v4-template](https://github.com/new?template_name=v4-template&template_owner=uniswapfoundation)_, which has pre-configured dependencies and tests for Uniswap v4

Clone the repository made from _v4-template_
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_repo>
```

Install dependencies
```bash
forge install
```

## Manual Setup

After cloning the repository, and installing foundry, developers can manually set up their Uniswap v4 environment:

1. Initialize a foundry project
    ```bash
    forge init . --force
    ```

2. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    forge install uniswap/v4-core
    forge install uniswap/v4-periphery
    ```

3. Set the `remappings.txt` to:
    ```
    @uniswap/v4-core/=lib/v4-core/
    forge-gas-snapshot/=lib/v4-core/lib/forge-gas-snapshot/src/
    forge-std/=lib/v4-core/lib/forge-std/src/
    permit2/=lib/v4-periphery/lib/permit2/
    solmate/=lib/v4-core/lib/solmate/
    v4-periphery/=lib/v4-periphery/
    ```
