# Token Mint

As part of the initial deployments, a minting contract `UNIMinter` will deployed to handle the minting and distribution of UNI tokens.

Please note the original `UNI` mint mechanics are still enforced:

1. Mints can only be performed once every 365 days
2. Mints are capped at 2% of the total UNI supply, inclusive of the supply held by `address(0xdead)` (the recipient of UNI on `Firepit.release()`)

The `owner` (Uniswap Governance) will be able to:

* Designate multiple recipients of minted tokens, with varying allocations
* Remove and revoke allocations, with a delay
* Appoint a new minting contract, replacing the current implementation

Altruistic actors will be responsible for:

* Minting & distributing tokens to the designated recipients
* Executing the revocation of an allocation after the delay period

### Governance Calls

To add a recipient for the next token mint, governance should call [`UNIMinter.grantShares()`](/technical-reference/UNIMinter#grantShares)
* The receiving address of the minted tokens
* The number of shares (out of 10,000 total) to allocate to the recipient
  - The number of shares are proportional to the total number of shares allocated:
    - A single recipient of 1000 shares will receive the entirety of the 10% of maximum mint
    - Two recipients of 4000 shares and 4000 shares will equally split 80% of the maximum mint
* The number of days notice before shares are entirely revocable

To remove a recipient, governance should call [`UNIMinter.initiateRevokeShares()`](/technical-reference/UNIMinter#initiateRevokeShares)
* The index of the recipient in the `shares` array
* If the revocation extends into the next mint, shares will be proportionally reduced for the next mint
* If the revocation completes before the next mint, shares will be entirely removed for the next mint
