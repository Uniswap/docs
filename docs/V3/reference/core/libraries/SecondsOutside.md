Contains methods for working with a mapping from tick to 32 bit timestamp values, specifically seconds
spent outside the tick.

The mapping uses int24 for keys since ticks are represented as int24 and there are 8 (2^3) values per word.
Note "seconds outside" is always a relative measurement, only consistent for as long as a the lower tick and upper tick
have gross liquidity greater than 0.

## Functions
### initialize
```solidity
  function initialize(
    mapping(int24 => uint256) self,
    int24 tick,
    int24 tickCurrent,
    int24 tickSpacing,
    uint32 time
  ) internal
```
Called the first time a tick is used to set the seconds outside value. Assumes the tick is not
initialized.


#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`self` | mapping(int24 => uint256) | the packed mapping of tick to seconds outside
|`tick` | int24 | the tick to be initialized
|`tickCurrent` | int24 | the current tick
|`tickSpacing` | int24 | the spacing between usable ticks
|`time` | uint32 | the current timestamp

### clear
```solidity
  function clear(
    mapping(int24 => uint256) self,
    int24 tick,
    int24 tickSpacing
  ) internal
```
Called when a tick is no longer used, to clear the seconds outside value of the tick


#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`self` | mapping(int24 => uint256) | the packed mapping of tick to seconds outside
|`tick` | int24 | the tick to be cleared
|`tickSpacing` | int24 | the spacing between usable ticks

### cross
```solidity
  function cross(
    mapping(int24 => uint256) self,
    int24 tick,
    int24 tickSpacing,
    uint32 time
  ) internal
```
Called when an initialized tick is crossed to update the seconds outside for that tick. Must be called
every time an initialized tick is crossed


#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`self` | mapping(int24 => uint256) | the packed mapping of tick to seconds outside
|`tick` | int24 | the tick to be crossed
|`tickSpacing` | int24 | the spacing between usable ticks
|`time` | uint32 | the current block timestamp truncated to 32 bits

### get
```solidity
  function get(
    mapping(int24 => uint256) self,
    int24 tick,
    int24 tickSpacing
  ) internal view returns (uint32)
```
Get the seconds outside for an initialized tick. Should be called only on initialized ticks.


#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`self` | mapping(int24 => uint256) | the packed mapping of tick to seconds outside
|`tick` | int24 | the tick to get the seconds outside value for
|`tickSpacing` | int24 | the spacing between usable ticks

#### Return Values:
| Type          | Description                                                                  |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uint32 | seconds outside value for that tick
### secondsInside
```solidity
  function secondsInside(
    mapping(int24 => uint256) self,
    int24 tickLower,
    int24 tickUpper,
    int24 tickCurrent,
    int24 tickSpacing
  ) internal view returns (uint32)
```
Get the seconds inside a tick range, assuming both tickLower and tickUpper are initialized


#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`self` | mapping(int24 => uint256) | the packed mapping of tick to seconds outside
|`tickLower` | int24 | the lower tick for which to get seconds inside
|`tickUpper` | int24 | the upper tick for which to get seconds inside
|`tickCurrent` | int24 | the current tick
|`tickSpacing` | int24 | the spacing between usable ticks

#### Return Values:
| Name                           | Type          | Description                                                                  |
| :----------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`a`| uint32 | relative seconds inside value that can be snapshotted and compared to a later snapshot to compute
time spent between tickLower and tickUpper, i.e. time that a position's liquidity was in use.
