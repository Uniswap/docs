Any contract that calls IUniswapV3PoolActions#mint must implement this interface


## Functions
### uniswapV3MintCallback
```solidity
  function uniswapV3MintCallback(
    uint256 amount0Owed,
    uint256 amount1Owed,
    bytes data
  ) external
```
Called to `msg.sender` after minting liquidity to a position from IUniswapV3Pool#mint.

In the implementation you must pay the pool tokens owed for the minted liquidity.
The caller of this method must be checked to be a UniswapV3Pool deployed by the canonical UniswapV3Factory.

|`amount0Owed` | uint256 | The amount of token0 due to the pool for the minted liquidity
