# LLMs and AI Integration

Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI tools can help developers better understand and work with the Uniswap Protocol. This section provides resources and guidance for leveraging AI assistance when building on Uniswap.

## AI-Powered Documentation

The Uniswap documentation is designed to work seamlessly with modern AI tools to provide enhanced developer support and assistance.

### Getting AI Help

Use the built-in AI integration features throughout the documentation:

- **Copy to AI**: Use the dropdown button on any documentation page to quickly get AI assistance
- **Context-Aware**: AI tools receive relevant documentation context for better responses
- **Multiple Platforms**: Integrate with popular AI assistants like Claude and ChatGPT

## LLMs.txt

This documentation includes an [LLMs.txt file](/llms.txt) that provides comprehensive context about Uniswap for AI systems. This file helps ensure AI assistants can provide accurate and up-to-date information about:

- Protocol architecture and concepts
- Smart contract interfaces and functionality
- SDK usage and integration patterns
- Development best practices

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

When using AI tools for Uniswap development:

1. **Provide Context**: Always include relevant protocol version (v2, v3, v4) in your queries
2. **Verify Code**: Always test and verify AI-generated code before deployment
3. **Reference Documentation**: Cross-check AI responses against official documentation
4. **Security First**: Have AI-generated smart contracts audited before production use

## Supported AI Platforms

The documentation provides optimized integration with:

- **Claude**: Advanced reasoning for complex DeFi concepts
- **ChatGPT**: Code generation and debugging assistance
- **Other LLMs**: Compatible with any AI tool that supports context injection
