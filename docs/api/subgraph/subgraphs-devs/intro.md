## Uniswap V3 SubGraph Docs 
Welcome to exploring the data of [**Uniswap**](https://uniswap.org/), the leading EVM DEX. The docs help you understand data structure in the **SubGraphs** deployed for the dex on the [graph protocol](https://thegraph.com/).

If you're completely new to the working of the V3 protocol, would recommend going through the [references](#references) below.

## Uniswap Foundation
The docs was possible as I recieved a grant from [Uniswap Foundation](https://uniswapfoundation.mirror.xyz/). The foundation publishes [grant wishlist for RFPs](https://uniswap.notion.site/Uniswap-Foundation-Grants-Wish-List-3be614ba4e504b5caeee7b0159e64a42) regularly if you wish to get involved.

## Get In Touch
For any updates or additions, you can raise a PR to the [docs repo](https://github.com/vintageplayer/uniswap-v3-subgraph-docs).

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/artsofbaniya) to discuss about web3 or any field, or just to keep up with what I'm building.
