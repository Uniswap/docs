## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Uniswap", some of which may confuse new users.

- **[Uniswap Labs](https://x.com/Uniswap)**: The company which developed the Uniswap protocol, along with the web interface.
- **[Uniswap Foundation](https://www.uniswapfoundation.org/)**: A non-profit organization that supports the development of the Uniswap protocol and its DeFi ecosystem.
- **[Uniswap Protocol](https://github.com/Uniswap/contracts)**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **[Uniswap Interface](https://app.uniswap.org/)**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Uniswap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Uniswap protocol.
- **[Uniswap Governance](https://gov.uniswap.org/)**: A governance system for governing the Uniswap Protocol, enabled by the UNI token.
