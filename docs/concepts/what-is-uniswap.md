## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Uniswap", some of which may confuse new users.

- **Uniswap Labs**: The company which developed the Uniswap protocol, along with the web interface.
- **Uniswap Foundation**: Dedicated to fostering the growth of all of DeFi and the Uniswap Protocol by supporting developers, researchers, and governance contributors in building a thriving DeFi ecosystem.
- **The Uniswap Protocol**: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **The Uniswap Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Uniswap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Uniswap protocol.
- **Uniswap Governance**: A governance system for governing the Uniswap Protocol, enabled by the UNI token.
