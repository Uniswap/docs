## Introduction

This guide will cover how to fetch Positions from the Blockchain.
Like the [Liquidity Position guide](./01-position-data.md) it doesn't have an accompanying example, nevertheless the concepts and functions used here can be found among the various examples that interact with liquidity positions.

If you need an introduction to liquidity positions, check out the [Liquidity Position guide](./01-position-data.md)

The [NonfungiblePositionManager Contract](../../../../contracts/v3/reference/periphery/NonfungiblePositionManager.md) can be used to create Positions, as well as get information on **existing Positions**.
In this guide, we will fetch **all Positions** an address has and fetch the **detailed Position Data** for those positions.

The guide will **cover**:

1. Fetching all positions for an address.
2. Fetching the position info for the positions.

:::info
The SDKs that are used in the guide are now published by the [Uniswap Foundation](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation) instead of Uniswap Labs.
You can find a list of supported SDKs [here](https://www.npmjs.com/org/uniswapfoundation).
Make sure you don't mix SDKs published by Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation to avoid unpredictable behavior.

For this guide, the following Uniswap packages are used:

- [`@uniswapfoundation/v3-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswapfoundation/v3-sdk)
- [`@uniswapfoundation/sdk-core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswapfoundation/sdk-core)

## Fetching the number of Positions

We want to fetch all Positions for our address.
We first fetch the number of positions an address owns using the `getPositionCount` function:

```typescript
import ethers from 'ethers'
import { Position } from '@uniswapfoundation/v3-sdk'

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('...rpcUrl')

// Address we want to fetch the positions for
const address = '...'

const positionCount: bigint = await Position.getPositionCount(provider, address)
```

Depending on the number of Positions this address owns, we may want to fetch them individually or all at once.

## Fetching individual Positions

If we want to paginate the positions an address owns we can fetch them one by one using the `getPositionForAddressAndIndex` function:

```typescript
let index = 0

const position: Position = await getPositionForAddressAndIndex(
    provider,
    address,
    index
)
```

We can use the position count we fetched earlier to create a loop for all positions we want to fetch.

## Fetching all Positions for an address

To fetch all Positions at once, we can use the `getAllPositionsForAddress` function:

```typescript
const allPositions: Position[] = await getAllPositionsForAddress(
    provider,
    address
)
```

This call may be too heavy for addresses that have hundreds of Positions.

## Fetching a Position with its Id

In some cases we may know the id of a specific Position, for example if we just created it.
We can use the `fetchWithPositionId` function to fetch the Position:

```typescript

const position: Position = await fetchWithPositionId(
    provider,
    positionId
)
```

## Next Steps

Now that we know how to fetch Positions, let's move to the next guide on [modifying Positions](./04-modifying-position.md).
