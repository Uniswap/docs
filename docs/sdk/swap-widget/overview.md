Welcome to the Uniswap Swap Widget. To begin, we recommend looking at the [**Guides**](./guides/swap-widget.mdx) and for deeper reference see the [**Swap Widget GitHub**](https://github.com/Uniswap/widgets) repo.

# Alpha software

The latest version of the Swap Widget is in production in the Uniswap Interface, but it is considered Alpha software and may contain bugs or change significantly between patch versions.

:::info 
There are likely to be issues and will take modification to make work as desired. This also has not been updated, and there are no current plans for working on this.
