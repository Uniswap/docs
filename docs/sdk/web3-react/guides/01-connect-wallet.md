---     

## Introduction

This guide will cover how to connect wallets with `web3-react`. It is based on the [`web3-react` example](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/tree/main/web3-react) found in the Uniswap code examples [repository](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples). To run this example, check out the examples's [README](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/web3-react/README.md) and follow the setup instructions.


In this example we will walk through setting up `web3-react` and connecting the most popular browser-injected connector, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), using [@web3-react/metamask](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/metamask).


The input parameters to this guide are the chains that we want our app to be able to connect to and their RPC URLs.

The guide will **cover**:

1. Creating a `web3-react` `Web3ReactProvider`
2. Building a `web3-react` `InjectedConnector`
3. Connecting and disconnecting the application to the connector

At the end of the guide, we should be able to connect and disconnect your dApp to a MetaMask connector.

For this guide, the following `web3-react` packages are used:

- [`@web3-react/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/core)
- [`@web3-react/types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/types)
- [`@web3-react/metamask`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/metamask)

:::info
This guide uses `web3-react` version 8, which is a beta version.
:::

These will be automatically installed by following the example's [README](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/web3-react/README.md).

The core code of this guide can be found in [Web3ContextProvider](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/web3-react/src/libs/components/Web3ContextProvider.tsx) and [InjectedConnector](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/main/web3-react/src/libs/injected.ts).

## Creating a `Web3ReactProvider`

To be able to interact with the methods that `web3-react` offers, we first need to setup a `Web3ReactProvider` and wrap our application in it. `web3-react` uses a [React `Context`](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to allow us to use the exposed hooks without additional configuration. 

To start, we create a React component called `Web3ContextProvider` in order to wrap the logic of configuring the `Web3ReactProvider`. In this component, we first import  `Web3ReactProvider` from [@web3-react/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/core).

The component receives just one prop which is the `children` to which it will be providing the `Context`:

```typescript reference title="Defining the Web3React component" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/81ec93e97b0afded621e177fe5f34fc9f98f80b0/web3-react/src/libs/components/Web3ContextProvider.tsx#L24
```

We then implement the component by rendering the imported `Web3ReactProvider` with the `children` within that:


```typescript reference title="Implementing the component" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/81ec93e97b0afded621e177fe5f34fc9f98f80b0/web3-react/src/libs/components/Web3ContextProvider.tsx#L30-L34
```

Note that we map our list of [`Connections`](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/856dbb002e7f38120554ef226f4309c96ce6ea79/web3-react/src/libs/connections.ts#L10) to a *tuple* of the `connector` and `hooks` of the connection. The third element of a `Connection` refers to the [type](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/06980acc8f6d484b719d2c60f5bfe9d766cb95d6/web3-react/src/libs/connections.ts#L16) of `Connection` being established, which we will later use to keep track of the actively connected wallet.

Finally, having created the `Web3ContextProvider` component, we can navigate to our [index file](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/feat/web3-react/web3-react/src/index.tsx) and wrap the whole application with it:

```typescript reference title="Wrapping our app with the web3 context" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/7ac3853bc465aecc428a32be584bbeb833b0a63c/web3-react/src/index.tsx#L16-L22
```

## Building an Injected Connector

The only parameter that we provided to the `Web3ReactProvider` component is a list of prioritized connectors, declared as `PRIORITIZED_CONNECTORS`. The prioritization ordering is with regards to which connector we want to be active when more than one connector is connected to our application. The list is defined inside our connectors module: 
```typescript reference title="Creating the prioritized Connectors list" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/8c0e36ca8d2ba4718af944094191f39da62a9c5c/web3-react/src/libs/connections.ts#L33-L39
```

Each one of those connectors lives within its own file, and they all follow a similar setup pattern. 

An example of a connector in the list is the `InjectedConnector`, which supports wallets that inject an *Ethereum Provider* into the browser window. The most popular example of an injected connector is the *MetaMask* browser extension. To set it up, we import `initializeConnector` function from [core]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/core)) and the `MetaMask` type from [metamask]((https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web3-react/core)):

```typescript reference title="Importing Connector dependencies" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/856dbb002e7f38120554ef226f4309c96ce6ea79/web3-react/src/libs/injected.ts#L1-L2
```

We then utilize the templated `initializeConnector` function with `MetaMask` as the type argument:

```typescript reference title="Initializing the MetaMask connector" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/81ec93e97b0afded621e177fe5f34fc9f98f80b0/web3-react/src/libs/injected.ts#L7-L9
```

By passing in `MetaMask` as the type argument, we define the function's required input parameters. In this case, the only parameter we need to pass is an instance of `Metamask`, which receives the `actions` and `onError` parameters. The first parameter defines the actions that `web3-react` performs on its local store for the connector (this usually can be passed through without modification), while the second parameter is the callback invoked when an error occurs.

The return type of the function is a tuple of the initialized `Connector` and the `Hooks` that we can use on it. Using this tuple, we create an instance of a [`Connection`](https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/856dbb002e7f38120554ef226f4309c96ce6ea79/web3-react/src/libs/connections.ts#L10) type, by setting the `type` property to `INJECTED`:


```typescript reference title="Creating a connection instance" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/856dbb002e7f38120554ef226f4309c96ce6ea79/web3-react/src/libs/injected.ts#L16-L20
```

Finally, we return the instance of `Connection` we created, which is added to the list of prioritized connectors.

## Connecting and  disconnecting the application to the connector

Having built our `InjectedConnector`, we can now use it in the Context that allows our application to use that connector:

```typescript reference title="Creating the Option component" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/81ec93e97b0afded621e177fe5f34fc9f98f80b0/web3-react/src/libs/components/Option.tsx#L5-L11
```

The component receives 5 parameters:
- `isEnabled` determines whether the connector is eligible to be activated
- `isConnected` determines whether the connector is currently active 
- `connectionType` determines the `ConnectionType`
- `onActivate` is called once the component has established a connection 
- `onDeactivate` is called once the component has disconnected

In the case of *MetaMask*, when declaring the `InjectedConnector` we pass the connector-specific arguments:

```typescript reference title="Creating an injected connector" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/81ec93e97b0afded621e177fe5f34fc9f98f80b0/web3-react/src/libs/components/ConnectionOptions.tsx#L26-L32
```

Then, in the `html` portion of the `Option`, we can figure out whether we want the current `Option`'s action button to be disabled, and whether clicking the button would result in the connector being connected or disconnected:

```typescript reference title="The component user interface" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/81ec93e97b0afded621e177fe5f34fc9f98f80b0/web3-react/src/libs/components/Option.tsx#L38-L42
```

Finally, we also have enough information to figure out what action to take when the button is clicked. In the case that the click triggers a connection:

```typescript reference title="On connecting to a Connector" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/8c0e36ca8d2ba4718af944094191f39da62a9c5c/web3-react/src/libs/components/Option.tsx#L38-L42
```

To connect our wallet, all we need to do is to call the `tryActivateConnector` function and pass it the `InjectedConnector`. We then call the `onActivate` callback, which makes the `InjectedConnector` the active connector in our application's state.


`tryActivateConnector` takes as its argument the connector that we want to activate, and attempts to call `activate` on it. If this activation succeeds, it returns the new `ConnectionType`:


```typescript reference title="The implementation of tryActivateConnector" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/8c0e36ca8d2ba4718af944094191f39da62a9c5c/web3-react/src/libs/connections.ts#L90-L92
```


In the case that the click triggers a disconnection:

```typescript reference title="On disconnecting from a Connector" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/8c0e36ca8d2ba4718af944094191f39da62a9c5c/web3-react/src/libs/components/Option.tsx#L29-L36
```


To disconnect, all we need to do is to call `tryDeactivateConnector` and pass in it the `InjectedConnector` we created before. We then call the `onDeactivate` callback, which removes the `InjectedConnector` as the currently active connector from our application's state.

`tryDeactivateConnector` takes as its argument the connector that we want to deactivate, and attempts to call `deactivate` on it. If this deactivation succeeds, it resets the connector's state by calling `resetState` and returns `null`:

```typescript reference title="The implementation of tryDeactivateConnector" referenceLinkText="View on GitHub" customStyling
https://github.com/Uniswap/examples/blob/81ec93e97b0afded621e177fe5f34fc9f98f80b0/web3-react/src/libs/connections.ts#L98-L100
```

## Next Steps

Now that we have gone through connecting and disconnecting from an `InjectedConnector`, we will learn how to [connect and disconnect](./02-connectors.md) from all the different types of connectors that `web3-react` supports.
