## üìù Contributing Documentation

### Writing Overviews

A product overview should clearly address the following key points:

- **Main Components:** What are the high level components of the product?
- **Core Functionality:** What are the high level features and functions it provides?
- **Source Code Location:** Where can the product's source code be found?
- **Integration:** Where can the code artifact (e.g., npm) be accessed, and how can someone integrate it into their project?

For a good example, check out the [V3 Smart Contracts overview](./docs/contracts/v3/overview.md).

### Writing Guides

A guide is a reusable code example that illustrates a specific concept within the Uniswap ecosystem.

#### Structure of Guides

**1. Introduction:** Explain the concept of the piece of code and summarize what will be covered and the end result.

**2. Walkthrough:** Provide a step-by-step explanation of each line of code.

**3. Output:** Show the testable end results.

#### Key Principles of Guides

Each guide should:
- Be a standalone piece.
- Refer to a code example in our example repository.
- Use the least dependencies possible.
- Include input changes (e.g., address, tokens, amounts) in the code.

#### Best Practices for Guides

- Don't show unnecessary source code snippets. Instead, link to external source code or technical references.
- Keep all links and references at the bottom and reference them as footnotes to minimize distractions.
- Help the developer build something within **10 minutes** per guide, but provide references for deep dives.
- End a guide with a transition to the subsequent guide, recommendations, or real-world project examples.

By implementing these consistent principles and practices, Uniswap will have documentation that is easy to understand and produces reusable code for its community.

A good example is the [V3 SDK Guides](./docs/sdk/v3/guides/01-quick-start.md).

### Writing Technical References

These should provide technical references for the exported interfaces. For a good example, see the [V3 SDK reference](./docs/sdk/v3/reference/overview). You can create these reference files by following the [guides](#generating-technical-references) below.

# üîß Generating Technical References

## From Solidity Natspec Comments

1. Install Solidity Docgen:
   ```bash
   npm install solidity-docgen
   ```

2. Get the correct Solidity compiler version:
	```bash
	npm install -D solc-0.7@npm:solc@0.7.6
	```
3. Place the updated contract.hbs template in a /templates folder in the same directory as /contracts.

4. Run Docgen:
	```bash
	npx solidity-docgen --solc-module solc-0.7 -t ./templates
	```

## From TypeScript Comments

1. Install Typedoc and Markdown Plugin:
	```bash
	npm install --save-dev typedoc typedoc-plugin-markdown
	```

2. (Optional) Install TypeScript if needed:
	```bash
	npm install --save-dev typescript
	```

3. Generate Documentation:
	```bash
	npx typedoc --out <docs> src/index.ts
	```

> üí° Use the --skipErrorChecking flag if necessary to handle types fetched during transpilation (e.g., contract ABIs).

**Note:** For more details, see [typedoc-plugin-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typedoc-plugin-markdown).



# üîç How to Update search indices with algolia

1. **Create an `.env` file** with the following variables:
   - `APPLICATION_ID`
   - `API_KEY` (with write access)  
   If you don't have these, please ask an Engineering Manager for assistance.

2. **Edit the `config.json` file** if necessary:
   - Update the `start_url` with the new website URL.
   - Set the `sitemap_url` with the updated website URL (e.g., for docs: `https://docs.uniswap.org/sitemap.xml`).
   - Use `"v3-docs"` as the `index_name`.

3. **Install and start Docker Desktop:**  
   [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

4. **Install jq:**  
   ```bash
   brew install jq


5. Run the Docker container:
	```bash
	docker run -it --env-file=.env -e "CONFIG=$(cat ./config.json | jq -r tostring)" algolia/docsearch-scraper
	```


## Installation

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```console
yarn install
```

## Local Development
Start a local development server with:

```console
yarn run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without needing to restart the server.

## Clear Cache

To clear the cache, use:

```console
yarn docusaurus clear
```

## Build

Generate static content into the `build` directory with:

```console
yarn build
```

This content can be served using any static hosting service.

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to production via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/uniswap/docs) upon merging into the **main** branch.
