## General advice

- Playing with a controller (PC, Xbox, or any other controller compatible with your computer) is highly recommended

## Bat swings

- A bat can be swung in all possible directions: left, right, up, down, diagonals
- A bat can be swung by clicking the attack button. Longer button press makes the bat hit harder
- Bat can be swung during standing, running, and jumping
- Long press attack button during jumps is possible

## Moving

- As a 2D-Game, moving directions are left/right
- Directions can be changed during jumps/tumble

# Jumping

- Jump height can be altered by press-duration of jump button
- Directions can be changed during jumps/tumble

## Flying Hamburger

- Makes the bat hit much stronger - results most times in a direct kill
