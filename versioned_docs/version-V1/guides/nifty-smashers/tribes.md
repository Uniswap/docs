**Ape**

**Frog**

**Human**

- Pressing the SA button throws a bomb in the aimed direction (left, right, up, down, diagonals)
- The bomb has a flying curve and doesn't fly straight like bananas (if the bomb is not detonated prior, it remains on the ground)
- The bomb explodes after some time or after the SA button is pressed a second time
- Currently, the bomb can hit an opponent by hitting it or by explosion
- Bombs are the only SA that can hit the throwing DEGEN itself with its explosion
- Bombs can also be hit with a bat and fly in the aimed direction
