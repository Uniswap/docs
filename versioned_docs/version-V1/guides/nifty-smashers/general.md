## Scoring

- If a DEGEN is hit once and dies (falls off map) you get one point
- If a DEGEN is hit multiple times while unable to recover, you get points as often as the DEGEN was hit. It doesn’t matter if previous hits were done by another DEGEN. Last hit that is killing the DEGEN, gets all combo points
- Currently there is no cap of how often a DEGEN can be hit (combo’ed) but a cap on how much points you can get max (3 points for a 2-player match, and 5 points for 3- & 4-player matches)
- 2-player-match: 5pts to win a round
- 3- & 4-player-match: 10pts to win a round
- Matches are Best of 5 (Bo5). If there is a tie after the fifth round, the tied player move into a sudden death round

## Lag Indicator

- Your lag (ping speed) of your connection
- Lag usually means above 100ms

## Custom Lobby

- A custom lobby can be used to open a match in a chosen region. The creator of the lobby can see a code in the lobby map which can be shared with others
- If another DEGEN wants to join the lobby, he first needs to select the correct region and then type the lobby code into a input box

## How and why to change regions?

- Nifty Smasher is a fast paced game where good latency/ping is crucial. The nearer the chosen region is to the player’s location, the lower he should expect his ping to be
- After changing the region in the web/desktop-App, the current ping is displayed
