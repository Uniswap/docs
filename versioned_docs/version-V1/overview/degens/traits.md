There were a total of 1,023 traits and 21 selectable options after choosing a tribe during our genesis minting experience, making an almost infinite number of DEGEN combinations.

Character traits were randomly removed from the set of available traits as more charcters were created, making it difficult to know which options would end up as the rarest.

**While [background types](https://docs.niftyleague.com/overview/degens/backgrounds) come with special benefits like earnings multipliers, character traits are strictly cosmetic.**
