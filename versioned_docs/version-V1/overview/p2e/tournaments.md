Improve your gameplay skills, meet members of the community, and earn NFTL and other prizes by playing in a Nifty Smashers tournament!

Tournaments may be incentivized by rewards from our community treasury fund at the [Nifty League DAO](/docs/overview/nifty-dao/overview)'s discretion via token voting. Some tournament champions may even walk away with special prizes, like a key to the Citadel in Niftyverse!

Tournaments are announced via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NiftyLeague) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/niftyleague), and managed by Nifty League [Community Moderators](/docs/overview/team).

For any other activities you'd like to see implemented, please reach out to our team in Discord!
