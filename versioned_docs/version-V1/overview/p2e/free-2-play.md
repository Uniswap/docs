Free-to-Play will launch in February 2022. F2P is key to the renter and owner onboarding flow. We plan to launch initially on desktop, and later on mobile including Android and iOS.

In F2P, players will be able to jump into the game immediately. Wallets will need to be connected via integration, as players will earn a small amount of NFTL for 'grinding' in F2P.

Grinding will earn players $NFTL over time, which will help the player be able to earn enough to rent a Degen.

F2P players will not look like a typical DEGEN. It's important for other players to be able to distinguish between F2P and DEGEN owners/renters within the gaming ecosystem. Given this, F2P players will appear like 'dummy' DEGENs, and players will be able to select the tribe they wish to play, as testing a DEGEN trib prior to purchasing/renting is important.

It's important to note that our Desktop and browser-based games have completely different user bases (different matchmaking services).
