During minting, we surprised the community with a special Nifty League launch comic collection to say thank you for minting our collection and for being early 😁

Snapshots for comics were taken throughout the minting process for the first 4 comic pages at the following milestones: Page 1 - 2500 | Page 2 - 3500 | Page 3 - 5000 | Page 4 - 7500.

The Nifty League Comic Collection consists of 6 pages with comics 5 and 6 yet to be released. There will be a snapshot on **1/31/2022** for comic 5 awarded to all DEGEN holders, and comic 6 awarded to all wallets containing all 6 DEGEN tribes. All Meta background DEGENs will receive one comic 6 and all Legendary background DEGENs will receive two comic 6s. These will be made available via a claim on our website.

Each comic will be burnable at a future date to receive an in-game wearable or weapon in exchange for each page burned.

We are still determining exactly how many slots can be filled per DEGEN, but only 1 of each wearable is assignable per DEGEN NFT.

Below is a depiction of wearable multiplier strength for each corresponding wearable. The exact rates are still to be determined.

Comic 2 💪💪💪💪  
Comic 3 💪💪💪  
Comic 4 💪💪  
Comic 5 💪  
Comic 6 💪💪💪💪💪💪

### TL;DR

- Each comic can be burned for a in-game wearable item.
- These NFTs will be ERC-1155’s.
- Items modify a degen's P2E multiplier when worn.
- Alternatively, you can hold the comics for future utility we have not yet disclosed.
- All 6 comics can be burned together as a set for a special mystery item.
- This mystery item will NOT modify the P2E multiplier.
