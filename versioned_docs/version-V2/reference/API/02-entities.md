Entities define the schema of the subgraph, and represent the data that can be queried. Within each entity are sets of fields that store useful information related to the entity. Below is a list of the available entities within the Uniswap Subgraph, and descriptions for the available fields.

To see an interactive sandbox of all entities see the [Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2).

Each entity is defined with a value type, which will always be a base AssemblyScript type, or a custom type provided by The Graph's custom TypeScript library. For more information on value types see [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/assemblyscript-api#api-reference).

### Uniswap Factory

The Uniswap Factory entity is responsible for storing aggregate information across all Uniswap pairs. It can be used to view stats about total liquidity, volume, amount of pairs and more. There is only one UniswapFactory entity in the subgraph.

| Field Name        | Value Type | Description                                                     |

### User

A user entity is created for any address that provides liquidity to a pool on Uniswap. This entity
can be used to track open positions for users. LiquidyPosition entities can be referenced to get
specific data about each position.

| burns       | [Burn]     | array of Burn events within transaction, 0 or greater     |
| swaps       | [Swap]     | array of Swap events within transaction, 0 or greater     |

### Mint

Mint entities are created for every emitted Mint event on the Uniswap core contracts. The Mint entity stores key data about the event like token amounts, who sent the transaction, who received the liquidity, and more. This entity can be used to track liquidity provisions on pairs.

| Field Name   | Value Type  | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

| feeLiquidity | BigDecimal  | amount of tokens sent to fee recipient (if fee is on)     |

### Swap

Swap entities are created for each token swap within a pair. The Swap entity can be used to get things like swap size (in tokens and USD), sender, recipient and more. See the Swap overview page
for more information on amounts.

| Field Name  | Value Type  | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

| to          | Bytes       | recipient of output tokens                            |
| logIndex    | BigInt      | event index within transaction                        |
| amountUSD   | BigDecimal  | derived amount of tokens sold in USD                  |

### Bundle

The Bundle is used as a global store of derived ETH price in USD. Because there is
no guaranteed common base token across pairs, a global reference of USD price is useful
for deriving other USD values. The Bundle entity stores an updated weighted average of ETH<->Stablecoin pair prices. This provides a strong estimate for the USD price of ETH that can
be used in other places in the subgraph.

| Field Name | Value Type | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| id         | ID         | constant 1                                            |
| ethPrice   | BigDecimal | derived price of ETH in USD based on stablecoin pairs |

## Historical Entities

The subgraph tracks aggregated information grouped by days to provide insights to daily activity on Uniswap. While [time travel queries](https://blocklytics.org/blog/ethereum-blocks-subgraph-made-for-time-travel/) can be used for direct comparison against values in the past, it is much more expensive to query grouped data. For this reason the subgraph tracks information grouped in daily buckets, using timestamps provided by contract events. These entities can be used to query things like total volume on a given day, price of a token on a given day, etc.

For each DayData type, a new entity is created each day.

### UniswapDayData
