This section explains the Uniswap Subgraph and how to interact with it. The Uniswap subgraph indexes data from the Uniswap contracts over time. It organizes data about pairs, tokens, Uniswap as a whole, and more. The subgraph updates any time a transaction is made on Uniswap. The subgraph runs on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) protocol's hosted service and can be openly queried.

## Resources

[Subgraph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2) - sandbox for querying data and endpoints for developers.

[Uniswap V2 Subgraph](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-subgraph) - source code for deployed subgraph.

## Usage

The subgraph provides a snapshot of the current state of Uniswap and also tracks historical data. It is currently used to power [uniswap.info](https://uniswap.info/). **It is not intended to be used as a data source for structuring transactions (contracts should be referenced directly for the most reliable live data).**

## Making Queries

To learn more about querying a subgraph refer to [The Graph's documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction).

## Versions

The [Uniswap V2 Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/uniswap/uniswap-v2) only tracks data on Uniswap V2. For Uniswap V1 information see the [V1 Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/graphprotocol/uniswap).
