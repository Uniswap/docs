Uniswap protocol is goverened and upgraded by UNI token holders, using three distinct components; the UNI token, governance module, and Timelock. Together, these contracts allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes to the uniswap protocol.

Any addresses with more than 10M UNI delegated to it may propose governance actions, which contain finished, executable code. When a proposal is created, the community can cast their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 4M votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and may be executed in a minimum of 2 days.

## Timelock

The Timelock contract can modify system parameters, logic, and contracts in a 'time-delayed, opt-out' upgrade pattern. Timelock has a hard-coded minimum delay of 2 days, which is the least amount of notice possible for a governance action. Each proposed action will be published at a minimum of 2 days in the future from the time of announcement. Major upgrades, such as changing the risk system, may have up to a 30 day delay. Timelock is controlled by the governance module; pending and completed governance actions can be monitored on the Timelock Dashboard.

# State-Changing Functions: UNI

## Delegate

```solidity
function delegate(address delegatee)
```

Delegate votes from the sender to the delegatee. Users can delegate to 1 address at a time, and the number of votes added to the delegatee’s vote count is equivalent to the balance of UNI in the user’s account. Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the sender delegates again, or transfers their UNI.

| Name      | Type      |                                                                    |

## Delegate By Signature

```solidity
function delegateBySig(address delegatee, uint nonce, uint expiry, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
```

Delegate votes from the sender to the delegatee. Users can delegate to 1 address at a time, and the number of votes added to the delegatee’s vote count is equivalent to the balance of UNI in the user’s account. Votes are delegated from the current block and onward, until the sender delegates again, or transfers their UNI.

| Name      | Type      |                                                                                                                     |

# State-Changing Functions: Governor Alpha

## Propose

```solidity
function propose(address[] memory targets, uint[] memory values, string[] memory signatures, bytes[] memory calldatas, string memory description) returns (uint)
```

Creates a Proposal to change the protocol.

Proposals will be voted on by delegated voters. If there is sufficient support before the voting period ends, the proposal shall be automatically enacted. Enacted proposals are queued and executed in the Timelock contract.

The sender must hold more UNI than the current proposal threshold (proposalThreshold()) as of the immediately previous block. The proposal can have up to 10 actions (based on proposalMaxOperations()).

The proposer cannot create another proposal if they currently have a pending or active proposal. It is not possible to queue two identical actions in the same block (due to a restriction in the Timelock), therefore actions in a single proposal must be unique, and unique proposals that share an identical action must be queued in different blocks.

| Name        | Type      |                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| targets     | `address` | The ordered list of target addresses for calls to be made during proposal execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function.                 |
| values      | `uint`    | The ordered list of values (i.e. msg.value) to be passed to the calls made during proposal execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function |
| signatures  | `string`  | The ordered list of function signatures to be passed during execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function.                               |
| calldatas   | `bytes`   | The ordered list of data to be passed to each individual function call during proposal execution. This array must be the same length as all other array parameters in this function.    |
| description | `string`  | A human readable description of the proposal and the changes it will enact.                                                                                                             |

| Unnamed     | `uint`    | Returns ID of the new proposal                                                                                                                                                          |

## Queue

```solidity
function queue(uint proposalId)
```

After a proposal has succeeded, any address can call the queue method to move the proposal into the Timelock queue. A proposal can only be queued if it has succeeded.

| Name       | Type   |                                   |
| :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal |

## Execute

```solidity
function execute(uint proposalId) payable
```

After the Timelock delay period, any account may invoke the execute method to apply the changes from the proposal to the target contracts. This will invoke each of the actions described in the proposal.
This function is payable so the Timelock contract can invoke payable functions that were selected in the proposal.

| Name       | Type   |                                   |
| :--------- | :----- | :-------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal |

## Cancel

```solidity
function queue(uint proposalId)
```

Cancel a proposal that has not yet been executed. The Guardian is the only one who may execute this unless the proposer does not maintain the delegates required to create a proposal. If the proposer does not have more delegates than the proposal threshold, anyone can cancel the proposal.

| Name       | Type   |                            |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a proposal to cancel |

## Cast Vote

```solidity
function castVote(uint proposalId, bool support)
```

Cast a vote on a proposal. The account's voting weight is determined by it's number of delegated votes at the time the proposal becomes active.

| Name       | Type   |                                                                     |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| proposalId | `uint` | ID of a given successful proposal                                   |
| support    | `bool` | A boolean of true for 'yes' or false for 'no' on the proposal vote. |

## Cast Vote By Signature

```solidity
function castVoteBySig(uint proposalId, bool support, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
```

Cast a vote on a proposal. The account's voting weight is determined its number of delegated votes at the time the proposal became active. This method has the same purpose as Cast Vote, but instead enables offline signatures to participate in governance voting. For more details on how to create an offline signature, review EIP-712.

| Name       | Type      |                                                                                         |
| :--------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| proposalId | `uint`    | ID of a given successful proposal                                                       |
| support    | `bool`    | A boolean of true for 'yes' or false for 'no' on the proposal vote.                     |
| expiry     | `uint`    | The time when the signature expires. A block timestamp in seconds since the unix epoch. |
| v          | `uint`    | The recovery byte of the signature.                                                     |
| r          | `bytes32` | Half of the ECDSA signature pair.                                                       |
| s          | `bytes32` | Half of the ECDSA signature pair.                                                       |
