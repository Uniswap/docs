Because routers are stateless and do not hold token balances, they can be replaced safely and trustlessly, if necessary. This may happen if more efficient smart contract patterns are discovered, or if additional functionality is desired. For this reason, routers have _release numbers_, starting at `01`. This is currently recommended release, `02`.

## addLiquidity

```solidity
function addLiquidity(
  address tokenA,
  address tokenB,
  uint amountADesired,
  uint amountBDesired,
  uint amountAMin,
  uint amountBMin,
  address to,
  uint deadline
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB, uint liquidity);
```

Adds liquidity to an ERC-20⇄ERC-20 pool.

- To cover all possible scenarios, `msg.sender` should have already given the router an allowance of at least amountADesired/amountBDesired on tokenA/tokenB.
- Always adds assets at the ideal ratio, according to the price when the transaction is executed.
- If a pool for the passed tokens does not exists, one is created automatically, and exactly amountADesired/amountBDesired tokens are added.

  uint amountTokenMin,
  uint amountETHMin,
  address to,

) external payable returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH, uint liquidity);
```

Adds liquidity to an ERC-20⇄WETH pool with ETH.

- To cover all possible scenarios, `msg.sender` should have already given the router an allowance of at least amountTokenDesired on token.
- Always adds assets at the ideal ratio, according to the price when the transaction is executed.
- `msg.value` is treated as a amountETHDesired.
- Leftover ETH, if any, is returned to `msg.sender`.
- If a pool for the passed token and WETH does not exists, one is created automatically, and exactly amountTokenDesired/`msg.value` tokens are added.

Receive an exact amount of tokens for as little ETH as possible, along the route determined by the path. The first element of path must be [WETH](#weth), the last is the output token and any intermediate elements represent intermediate pairs to trade through (if, for example, a direct pair does not exist).

- Leftover ETH, if any, is returned to `msg.sender`.
