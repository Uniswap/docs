## Events
### Initialize
```solidity
  event Initialize(
    uint160 sqrtPriceX96,
    int24 tick
  )
```
Emitted exactly once by a pool when #initialize is first called on the pool

Mint/Burn/Swap cannot be emitted by the pool before Initialize

|`sqrtPriceX96`| uint160 | The initial sqrt price of the pool, as a Q64.96
|`tick`| int24 | The initial tick of the pool, i.e. log base 1.0001 of the starting price of the pool

    int24 tickUpper,
    uint128 amount,
    uint256 amount0,

    address recipient,
    uint128 amount0,
    uint128 amount0
  )
