Interface used by DAI/CHAI for permit


## Functions
### permit
```solidity
  function permit(
    address holder,
    address spender,
    uint256 nonce,
    uint256 expiry,
    bool allowed,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
  ) external
```
Approve the spender to spend some tokens via the holder signature

This is the permit interface used by DAI and CHAI

#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`holder` | address | The address of the token holder, the token owner
|`spender` | address | The address of the token spender
|`nonce` | uint256 | The holder's nonce, increases at each call to permit
|`expiry` | uint256 | The timestamp at which the permit is no longer valid
|`allowed` | bool | Boolean that sets approval amount, true for type(uint256).max and false for 0
|`v` | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s`
|`r` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s`
|`s` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v`
