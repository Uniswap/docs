Functionality to call permit on any EIP-2612-compliant token for use in the route

These functions are expected to be embedded in multicalls to allow EOAs to approve a contract and call a function
that requires an approval in a single transaction.

## Functions
### selfPermit
```solidity
  function selfPermit(
    address token,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
  ) public
```
Permits this contract to spend a given token from `msg.sender`

The `owner` is always msg.sender and the `spender` is always address(this).

#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`token` | address | The address of the token spent
|`value` | uint256 | The amount that can be spent of token
|`deadline` | uint256 | A timestamp, the current blocktime must be less than or equal to this timestamp
|`v` | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s`
|`r` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s`
|`s` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v`

### selfPermitIfNecessary
```solidity
  function selfPermitIfNecessary(
    address token,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 deadline,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
  ) external
```
Permits this contract to spend a given token from `msg.sender`

The `owner` is always msg.sender and the `spender` is always address(this).
Can be used instead of #selfPermit to prevent calls from failing due to a frontrun of a call to #selfPermit

#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`token` | address | The address of the token spent
|`value` | uint256 | The amount that can be spent of token
|`deadline` | uint256 | A timestamp, the current blocktime must be less than or equal to this timestamp
|`v` | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s`
|`r` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s`
|`s` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v`

### selfPermitAllowed
```solidity
  function selfPermitAllowed(
    address token,
    uint256 nonce,
    uint256 expiry,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
  ) public
```
Permits this contract to spend the sender's tokens for permit signatures that have the `allowed` parameter

The `owner` is always msg.sender and the `spender` is always address(this)

#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`token` | address | The address of the token spent
|`nonce` | uint256 | The current nonce of the owner
|`expiry` | uint256 | The timestamp at which the permit is no longer valid
|`v` | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s`
|`r` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s`
|`s` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v`

### selfPermitAllowedIfNecessary
```solidity
  function selfPermitAllowedIfNecessary(
    address token,
    uint256 nonce,
    uint256 expiry,
    uint8 v,
    bytes32 r,
    bytes32 s
  ) external
```
Permits this contract to spend the sender's tokens for permit signatures that have the `allowed` parameter

The `owner` is always msg.sender and the `spender` is always address(this)
Can be used instead of #selfPermitAllowed to prevent calls from failing due to a frontrun of a call to #selfPermitAllowed.

#### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`token` | address | The address of the token spent
|`nonce` | uint256 | The current nonce of the owner
|`expiry` | uint256 | The timestamp at which the permit is no longer valid
|`v` | uint8 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `s`
|`r` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `v` and `s`
|`s` | bytes32 | Must produce valid secp256k1 signature from the holder along with `r` and `v`
