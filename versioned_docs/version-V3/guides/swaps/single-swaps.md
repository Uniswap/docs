## Introduction

Swaps are the most common interaction with the Uniswap protocol. The examples below are implementations of the two styles of single swapping available on v3. Note the examples below are not production ready code, and are implemented in a simplistic manner for the purpose of learning.

## Setting up your environment

```
mkdir swap-example

cd swap-example

npm init
```

For this example, we'll use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to compile our contracts.

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

and install the V3 Periphery contracts so that we can interact with the router

```
npm add @uniswap/v3-periphery
```

and create a hardhat config file in our environment

```
npx hardhat
```

## setting hardhat solidity version

Now we'll need to change ./hardhat.config.js to include the appropriate solidity version

```js
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.7.6",
};
```

## Compiling our contract

We can compile our contracts with `npx hardhat compile`

## Setting up the Contract

contract SwapExamples {
    // For the scope of these swap examples,
    // we will detail the design considerations when using
    // `exactInput`, `exactInputSingle`, `exactOutput`, and  `exactOutputSingle`.

    // It should be noted that for the sake of these examples, we purposefully pass in the swap router instead of inherit the swap router for simplicity.
    // More advanced example contracts will detail how to inherit the swap router safely.

    ISwapRouter public immutable swapRouter;

    // This example swaps DAI/WETH9 for single path swaps and DAI/USDC/WETH9 for multi path swaps.

    address public constant DAI = 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F;
    address public constant WETH9 = 0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2;
    address public constant USDC = 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48;

    // For this example, we will set the pool fee to 0.3%.
    uint24 public constant poolFee = 3000;

    constructor(ISwapRouter _swapRouter) {
        swapRouter = _swapRouter;
    }
```

## Exact Input Swaps

```solidity
    /// @notice swapExactInputSingle swaps a fixed amount of DAI for a maximum possible amount of WETH9
    /// using the DAI/WETH9 0.3% pool by calling `exactInputSingle` in the swap router.
    /// @dev The calling address must approve this contract to spend at least `amountIn` worth of its DAI for this function to succeed.
    /// @param amountIn The exact amount of DAI that will be swapped for WETH9.
    /// @return amountOut The amount of WETH9 received.
    function swapExactInputSingle(uint256 amountIn) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        // msg.sender must approve this contract

        // Transfer the specified amount of DAI to this contract.
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(DAI, msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);

        // Approve the router to spend DAI.
        TransferHelper.safeApprove(DAI, address(swapRouter), amountIn);

        // Naively set amountOutMinimum to 0. In production, use an oracle or other data source to choose a safer value for amountOutMinimum.
        // We also set the sqrtPriceLimitx96 to be 0 to ensure we swap our exact input amount.
        ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams memory params =
            ISwapRouter.ExactInputSingleParams({
                tokenIn: DAI,
                tokenOut: WETH9,
                fee: poolFee,
                recipient: msg.sender,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountIn: amountIn,
                amountOutMinimum: 0,
                sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
            });

        // The call to `exactInputSingle` executes the swap.
        amountOut = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
    }
```

## Exact Output swaps

```solidity
    /// @notice swapExactOutputSingle swaps a minimum possible amount of DAI for a fixed amount of WETH.
    /// @dev The calling address must approve this contract to spend its DAI for this function to succeed. As the amount of input DAI is variable,
    /// the calling address will need to approve for a slightly higher amount, anticipating some variance.
    /// @param amountOut The exact amount of WETH9 to receive from the swap.
    /// @param amountInMaximum The amount of DAI we are willing to spend to receive the specified amount of WETH9.
    /// @return amountIn The amount of DAI actually spent in the swap.
    function swapExactOutputSingle(uint256 amountOut, uint256 amountInMaximum) external returns (uint256 amountIn) {
        // Transfer the specified amount of DAI to this contract.
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(DAI, msg.sender, address(this), amountInMaximum);

        // Approve the router to spend the specified `amountInMaximum` of DAI.
        // In production, you should choose the maximum amount to spend based on oracles or other data sources to achieve a better swap.
        TransferHelper.safeApprove(DAI, address(swapRouter), amountInMaximum);

        ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams memory params =
            ISwapRouter.ExactOutputSingleParams({
                tokenIn: DAI,
                tokenOut: WETH9,
                fee: poolFee,
                recipient: msg.sender,
                deadline: block.timestamp,
                amountOut: amountOut,
                amountInMaximum: amountInMaximum,
                sqrtPriceLimitX96: 0
            });

        // Executes the swap returning the amountIn needed to spend to receive the desired amountOut.
        amountIn = swapRouter.exactOutputSingle(params);

        // For exact output swaps, the amountInMaximum may not have all been spent.
        // If the actual amount spent (amountIn) is less than the specified maximum amount, we must refund the msg.sender and approve the swapRouter to spend 0.
        if (amountIn < amountInMaximum) {
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(DAI, address(swapRouter), 0);
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(DAI, msg.sender, amountInMaximum - amountIn);
        }
    }
```
