# Introduction

Swaps are the most common interaction with the Uniswap protocol. The examples below are implementations of the two styles of single swapping available on v3. Note the examples below are not production ready code, and are implemented in a simplistic manner for the purpose of learning.

# Setting up your environment

```
mkdir swap-example

cd swap-example

npm init
```

For this example, we'll use [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to compile our contracts.

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
``

and install the V3 Periphery contracts so that we can interact with the router

```

npm add @uniswap/v3-periphery

```

and create a hardhat config file in our environment

```

npx hardhat

````
# setting hardhat solidity version

Now we'll need to change ./hardhat.config.js to include the appropriate solidity version

```js
/**
 * @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig
 */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.7.6",
};

````

then we can compile our contracts with `npx hardhat compile`

# Exact Input Swaps

        // Naively set amountOutMinimum to 0. In production, use an oracle or other data source to choose a safer value for amountOutMinimum.
        // We also set the sqrtPriceLimitx96 to be 0 to ensure we swap our exact input amount.

        // The call to `exactInputSingle` executes the swap.
        amountOut = swapRouter.exactInputSingle(params);
    }
```

# Exact Output swaps

```solidity
    /// @notice swapExactOutputSingle swaps a minimum possible amount of DAI for a fixed amount of WETH.
    /// @dev The calling address must approve this contract to spend its DAI for this function to succeed. As the amount of input DAI is variable,

        // Approve the router to spend the specifed `amountInMaximum` of DAI.
        // In production, you should choose the maximum amount to spend based on oracles or other data sources to acheive a better swap.

        // Executes the swap returning the amountIn needed to spend to receive the desired amountOut.
        amountIn = swapRouter.exactOutputSingle(params);

        // For exact output swaps, the amountInMaximum may not have all been spent.
        // If the actual amount spent (amountIn) is less than the specified maximum amount, we must refund the msg.sender and approve the swapRouter to spend 0.
